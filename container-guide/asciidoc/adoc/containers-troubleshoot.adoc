=== Analyze container images with container-diff

In case a custom {deng} container image built on top of the {slea} base container image is not working as expected, the container-diff tool can help you analyze the image and collect information relevant for troubleshooting.

container-diff makes it possible to analyze image changes by computing differences between images and presenting the diff in a human-readable and actionable format. The tool can find differences in system packages, language-level packages, and files in a container image.

container-diff can handle local container images (using the prefix `daemon://`), images in a remote registry (using the prefix `remote://`), and images saved as `.tar` archives. You can use container-diff to compute the diff between a local version of an image and a remote version.

To install container-diff, run the `sudo zypper in container-diff` command.

==== Basic container-diff commands

The command `container-diff analyze IMAGE` runs a standard analysis on a single image. By default, it returns a hash and size of the container image. For more information that can help you to identify and fix problems, use the specific analyzers. Use the `--type` parameter to specify the desired analyzer. Two of the most useful analyzers are `history` (returns a list of descriptions of how an image layer was created) and `file` (returns a list of file system contents, including names, paths, and sizes):

....
> sudo container-diff analyze --type=history daemon://IMAGE
> sudo container-diff analyze --type=file daemon://IMAGE
....

To view all available parameters and their brief descriptions, run the `container-diff analyze --help` command.

Using the `container-diff diff` command, you can compare two container images and examine differences between them. Similar to the `container-diff analyze` command, `container-diff
    diff` supports several parameters. The example command below compares two images and returns a list of descriptions of how IMAGE_2 was created from IMAGE_1.

....
> sudo container-diff diff daemon://IMAGE_1 daemon://IMAGE_2 --type=history
....

To view all available parameters and their brief descriptions, run the `container-diff diff --help` command.
