== {bci}s

[[sec-bci-intro]]
=== Introduction to {bci}s

{bci} ({bcia}) are minimal {slsa} 15-based images that you can use to develop, deploy, and share applications. There are two types of {bcia}:

* General-purpose {bcia} can be used for building custom container images and for deploying applications.
* Language stack {bcia} provide minimal environments for developing and deploying applications in specific programming languages.

[[sec-bci-why]]
=== Why {bci}s

{bcia}s offer a platform for creating {slsa}-based custom container images and containerized applications that can be distributed freely. {bcia}s feature the same predictable enterprise lifecycle as {slsa}. The {slea}_{bcia} 15 SP3 and SP4 repository (which is a subset of the {slea} repository) gives {bcia}s access to 4000 packages available for the {x64}, {aarch64}, {ppc}, and {zseries} architectures. The packages in the repository have undergone quality assurance and security audits by {suse}. The container images are FIPS-compliant when running on a host in FIPS mode. In addition to that, {suse} can provide official support for {bcia}s through {suse} subscription plans.

Security::
  Each package in the {slea}_{bcia} repository undergoes security audits, and {bcia}s benefit from the same mechanism of dealing with CVEs as {sles}. All discovered and fixed vulnerabilities are announced via e-mail, the dedicated https://www.suse.com/security/cve/[CVE pages], and as OVAL and CVRF data. To ensure a secure supply chain, all container images are signed with Notary v1, {podman}'s GPG signatures, and Sigstore Cosign.
Stability::
  Since {bcia}s are based on {slsa}, they feature the same level of stability and quality assurance. Similar to {slsa}, {bcia}s receive maintenance updates that provide bug fixes, improvements, and security patches.
Tooling and integration::
  {bcia}s are designed to provide drop-in replacements for popular container images available on hub.docker.com. You can use the general-purpose {bcia}s and the tools they put at your disposal to create custom container images, while the language stack {bcia}s provide a foundation and the required tooling for building containerized applications.
Redistribution::
  {bci}s are covered by a permissive https://www.suse.com/de-de/licensing/eula/#bci[EULA] that allows you to redistribute custom container images based on a {bci}.

[[sec-bci-highlights]]
==== Highlights

* {bcia}s are fully compatible with {slsa}, but **they do not require a subscription to run and distribute them.**
* {bcia}s automatically run in FIPS-compatible mode when the host operating system is running in FIPS mode.
* Each {bcia} includes the RPM database, which makes it possible to audit the contents of the container image. You can use the RPM database to determine the specific version of the RPM package any given file belongs to. This allows you to ensure that a container image is not susceptible to known and already fixed vulnerabilities.
* All {bcia}s (except for those without {zypper}) come with the `container-suseconnect` service. This gives containers that run on a registered {slsa} host access to the full {slsa} repositories. `container-suseconnect` is invoked automatically when you run {zypper} for the first time, and the service adds the correct {slsa} repositories into the running container. On an unregistered {slsa} host or on a non-{slsa} host, the service does nothing.

[NOTE]
.{slea}_{bcia} repository
====
There is a {slea}_{bcia} repository for each {slea} service pack. This means that {bcia}s based on SP4 have access to the {slea}_{bcia} repository for SP4, all {bcia}s based on SP4 use the SLE_BCI repository for SP4, and so on. Each SLE_BCI repository contains all SLE packages except kernels, bootloaders, installers (including {yast}), desktop environments, and hypervisors (such as KVM and Xen).
====

[[sec-general-purpose-bci]]
=== General-purpose {bcia}s

There are four general purpose {bcia}s, and each container image comes with a minimum set of packages to keep its size low. You can use a general purpose {bcia} either as a starting point for building custom container images, or as a platform for deploying specific software.

{suse} offers several general-purpose {bcia}s that are intended as deployment targets or as foundations for creating customized images: {bcia}-Base, {bcia}-Minimal, {bcia}-Micro, and {bcia}-BusyBox. These images share the common {slsa} base, and none of them ship with a specific language or an application stack. All images feature the RPM database (even if the specific image does not include the RPM package manager) that can be used to verify the provenance of every file in the image. Each image includes the {slsa} certificate bundle, which allows the deployed applications to use the system's certificates to verify TLS connections.

The table below provides a quick overview of the differences between {bcia}-Base, {bcia}-Minimal, {bcia}-Micro, and {bcia}-BusyBox.

|===

==== {bcia}-Base and {bcia}-Init: When you need flexibility

This {bcia} comes with the Zypper package manager and the free {slea}_{bcia} repository. This allows you to install software available in the repository and customize the image during the build. The downside is the size of the image. It is the largest of the general-purpose {bcia}s, so it is not always the best choice for a deployment image.

A variant of {bcia}-Base called {bcia}-Init comes with systemd preinstalled. The {bcia}-Init container image can be useful in scenarios requiring systemd for managing services in a single container.

[IMPORTANT]
.Using {bcia}-init with {docker} or {nerdctl}
====
When using {bcia}-init container with {docker}, you must use the following arguments for SYSTEMD to work correctly in the container:

....
> docker run -ti --tmpfs /run -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw --cgroupns=host registry.suse.com/bci/bci-init:latest
....

In case of {nerdctl}, the correct command is as follows:

....
> nerdctl run -ti --env container=containerd --tmpfs /run -v /sys/fs cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw --cgroupns=host  registry.suse.com/bci bci-init:latest
....

To correctly shut down the container use the following command:

....
> docker kill -s SIGRTMIN+3 CONTAINER_ID
....
====

==== {bcia}-Minimal: When you do not need Zypper

This is a stripped-down version of the {bcia}-Base image. {bcia}-Minimal comes without Zypper, but it does have the RPM package manager installed. This significantly reduces the size of the image. However, while RPM can install and remove packages, it lacks support for repositories and automated dependency resolution. The {bcia}-Minimal image is therefore intended for creating deployment containers, and then installing the desired RPM packages inside the containers. Although you can install the required dependencies, you need to download and resolve them manually. However, this approach is not recommended as it is prone to errors.

[[sec-bci-variants-micro]]
==== {bcia}-Micro: When you need to deploy static binaries

This image is similar to {bcia}-Minimal but without the RPM package manager. The primary use case for the image is deploying static binaries produced externally or during multi-stage builds. As there is no straightforward way to install additional dependencies inside the container image, we recommend deploying a project using the {bcia}-Minimal image only when the final build artifact bundles all dependencies and has no external runtime requirements (like Python or Ruby).

[[sec-bci-variants-busybox]]
==== {bcia}-BusyBox: When you need the smallest and GPLv3-free image

Similar to {bcia}-Micro, the {bcia}-BusyBox image comes with the most basic tools only. However, these tools are provided by the BusyBox project. This has the benefit of further size reduction. Furthermore, the image contains no GPLv3 licensed software. When using the image, keep in mind that there are certain differences between the BusyBox tools and the GNU Coreutils. So scripts written for a system that uses GNU Coreutils may require modification to work with BusyBox.

[[sec-bci-variants-size]]
==== Approximate sizes

For your reference, the list below provides an approximate size of each {bcia}. Keep in mind that the provided numbers are rough estimations.

* `{bcia}-Base` ~94{nbsp}MB
* `{bcia}-Minimal` ~42{nbsp}MB
* `{bcia}-Micro` ~26{nbsp}MB
* `{bcia}-BusyBox` ~14{nbsp}MB

[[sec-language-stack-bci]]
=== Language stack {bcia}s

Language stack {bcia}s are built on top of the {bcia}-Base general-purpose {bcia}. Each container image comes with the {zypper} stack and the free `{slea}_{bcia}` repository. Additionally, each image includes most common tools for building and deploying applications in the specific language environment. This includes tools like a compiler or interpreter as well as the language specific package manager.

Below is an overview of the available language stack {bcia}s.

python::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/python/index.html
  * Ships with the python3 version from the tag and pip3, curl, git tools.
node::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/nodejs/index.html
  * Comes with nodejs version from the tag, npm and git. The yarn package manager can be installed with the `npm install -g yarn` command.
openjdk::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/openjdk/index.html
  * Ships with the OpenJDK runtime. Designed for deploying Java applications.
openjdk-devel::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/openjdk-devel/index.html
  * Includes the development part of OpenJDK in addition to the OpenJDK runtime. Instead of Bash, the default entry point is the jshell shell.
ruby::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/ruby/index.html
  * A standard development environment based on Ruby 2.5, featuring ruby, gem and bundler as well as git and curl.
golang::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/golang/index.html
  * Ships with the go compiler version specified in the tag.
dotnet-runtime::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/dotnet-runtime/index.html
  * Includes the .NET runtime from Microsoft and the Microsoft .NET repository.
dotnet-aspnet::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/bci/dotnet-aspnet/index.html
  * Ships with the ASP.NET runtime from Microsoft and the Microsoft .NET repository.
dotnet-sdk::
  * URL: https://registry.suse.com/static/bci/dotnet-sdk
  * Comes with the .NET and ASP.NET SDK from Microsoft as well as the Microsoft .NET repository.

[[sec-status-lifecycle-bci]]
=== Important note on status and lifecycle

All container images, except for base, are currently classified as tech preview, and {suse} does not provide official support for them. This information is visible on the web on https://registry.suse.com[registry.suse.com]. It is also indicated via the `com.suse.supportlevel` label whether a container image still has the tech preview status. You can use the skopeo and jq utilities to check the status of the desired {bcia} as follows:

....
> skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-micro:15.4 | jq '.Labels["com.suse.supportlevel"]'
"techpreview"

> skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 | jq '.Labels["com.suse.supportlevel"]'
"l3"
....

In the example above, the `com.suse.supportlevel` label is set to `techpreview` in the `bci-micro` container image, indicating that the image still has the tech preview status. The `bci-base` container image, on the other hand, has full L3 support. Unlike like the general purpose {bcia}s, the language stack {bcia}s may not follow the lifecycle of the {slsa} distribution: they are supported as long as the respective language stack receives support. In other words, new versions of {bcia}s (indicated by the OCI tags) may be released during the lifecycle of a {slsa} Service Pack, while older versions may become unsupported. Refer to https://suse.com/lifecycle[suse.com/lifecycle] to find out whether the container in question is still under support.

IMPORTANT: A {bci} is no longer updated after its support period ends. You will not receive any notification when that happens.

[[sec-verify-bci-cosign]]
=== Verifying {bcia}s with Cosign

To verify a {bcia}, run Cosign in the container. The command below fetches the
signing key from the SUSE server and uses it to verify the latest BCI-Base container
image.

[source,ShellSession]
----
> podman run --rm -it gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign verify \
    --key https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/keys/container–key.pem \
    registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest | tail -1 | jq

[
  {
    "critical": {
      "identity": {
        "docker-reference": "registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base"
      },
      "image": {
        "docker-manifest-digest": "sha256:52a828600279746ef669cf02a599660cd53faf4b2430a6b211d593c3add047f5"
      },
      "type": "cosign container image signature"
    },
    "optional": {
      "creator": "OBS"
    }
  }
]
----

The signing key can be used to verify all {bcia}s, and it also
ships with {slea} 15 (the `/usr/share/container-keys/suse-container-key.pem` file).

You can also check BCI container images against
https://github.com/sigstore/rekor[rekor], the immutable tamper resistant
ledger. For example:

[source,ShellSession]
----
> podman run --rm -it -e COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign \
    verify --key https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/keys/container–key.pem \
    registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest | tail -1 | jq
[
  {
    "critical": {
      "identity": {
        "docker-reference": "registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base"
      },
      "image": {
        "docker-manifest-digest": "sha256:52a828600279746ef669cf02a599660cd53faf4b2430a6b211d593c3add047f5"
      },
      "type": "cosign container image signature"
    },
    "optional": {
      "creator": "OBS"
    }
  }
]
----

If verification fails, the output of the `cosign verify` command is similar to the one below.

----
Error: no matching signatures:
crypto/rsa: verification error
main.go:62: error during command execution: no matching signatures:
crypto/rsa: verification error
----

[[sec-understanding-bci]]
=== Understanding {bcia}s

If you have a working knowledge of containers, you will not have any difficulties using {bcia}s. However, there are certain features that set {bcia}s apart from similar offerings, like images based on Debian or Alpine Linux. And understanding the specifics can help you to get the most out of {bcia}s in the shortest time possible.


[[sec-bci-package-manager]]
==== Package manager

The default package manager in {slsa} is {zypper}. Similar to APT in Debian and APK in Alpine Linux, {zypper} offers a command-line interface for all package management tasks. Below is brief overview of commonly used container-related {zypper} commands.

Install packages::
  `zypper --non-interactive install
         PACKAGE_NAME`
Add a repository::
  `zypper --non-interactive addrepo
         REPOSITORY_URL;` `zypper
         --non-interactive refresh`
Update all packages::
  `zypper --non-interactive update`
Remove a package::
  `zypper --non-interactive remove --clean-deps
         PACKAGE_NAME` (the `--clean-deps` flag ensures that no longer required dependencies are removed as well)
Clean up temporary files::
  `zypper clean`

For more information on using {zypper}, refer to https://documentation.suse.com/sles-15/html/{sles}-all/cha-sw-cl.html#sec-zypper.

All the described commands use the `--non-interactive` flag to skip confirmations, since you cannot approve these manually during container builds. Keep in mind that you must use the flag with any command that modifies the system. Also note that `--non-interactive` is not a "yes to all" flag. Instead, `--non-interactive` confirms what is considered to be the intention of the user. For example, an installation command with the `--non-interactive` option fails if it needs to import new repository signing keys, as that is something that the user must verify themselves.


[[sec-bci-suseconnect]]
==== Using container-suseconnect with {bcia}s

https://github.com/SUSE/container-suseconnect[`container-suseconnect`]
is a plugin available in all {bcia}s that ship with
Zypper. When the plugin detects the host's {sles}
registration credentials, it uses them to give the container access the
SUSE Linux Enterprise repositories. This includes additional modules and
previous package versions that are not part of the free `{slea}_{bcia}`
repository.

[[sec-bci-suseconnect-howto]]
=== Using container-suseconnect

If you are running a registered {slsa} system with {docker},
`container-suseconnect` automatically discovers your credentials and uses the subscription,
without requiring any action on your part.

On {opensuse} systems with {docker}, you must copy the files
`/etc/SUSEConnect` and `/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials` from a
registered {slsa} machine to your local machine. The
`/etc/SUSEConnect` file is required only if you are using {rmt} for
managing your registration credentials.

[[sec-bci-suseconnect-podman-buildah-nerdctl]]
==== Using container-suseconnect on non-{slea} hosts or with {podman}, {buildah}, and {nerdctl}

You need a registered {slsa} system to use `container-suseconnect` on
non-{slea} hosts or with {podman}, {buildah}, or with {nerdctl}. This can be a
physical machine, a virtual machine, or the BCI-Base container with
`SUSEConnect` installed and registered.

If you do not use {rmt}, copy
`/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials` to the development machine.
Otherwise, copy both the `/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials` and
`/etc/SUSEConnect` files.

You can use the following command to obtain `SCCcredentials` (replace
`REGISTRATION_CODE` with your {scc} registration code).

{docker}:

[source,Shell]
----
docker run --rm registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest bash -c \
    "zypper -n in SUSEConnect; SUSEConnect --regcode REGISTRATION_CODE; \
     cat /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials"
----

{podman}:

[source,Shell]
----
podman run --rm registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest bash -c \
    "zypper -n in SUSEConnect; SUSEConnect --regcode REGISTRATION_CODE; \
     cat /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials"
----

{nerdctl}:

[source,Shell]
----
nerdctl run --rm registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest bash -c \
    "zypper -n in SUSEConnect; SUSEConnect --regcode REGISTRATION_CODE; \
     cat /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials"
----

If you are running a container based on a {bcia}, mount
`SCCcredentials` (and optionally `/etc/SUSEConnect`) in the correct
destination. The following example shows how to mount `SCCcredentials`
in the current working directory.

{docker}:

[source,Shell]
----
docker run -v /path/to/SCCcredentials:/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials \
    --rm -it --pull=always registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest
----

{podman}:

[source,Shell]
----
podman run -v /path/to/SCCcredentials:/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials \
    --rm -it --pull=always registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest
----

{nerdctl}:

[source,Shell]
----
nerdctl run -v /path/to/SCCcredentials:/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials \
    --rm -it --pull=always registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest
----

Do not copy the `SCCcredentials` and `SUSEConnect` files into the
container image to avoid inadvertently adding them to the final image.
Use secrets instead, as they are only available to a single layer and
are not part of the built image. To do this, put a copy of
`SCCcredentials` (and optionally `SUSEConnect`) somewhere on the file
system and modify the `RUN` instructions that invoke {zypper} as follows:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest

RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SUSEConnect \
    --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials \
    zypper -n in fluxbox
----

{docker} and {buildah} support mounting secrets via the `--secret` flag
as shown below.

{docker}:

[source,Shell]
----
docker build --secret=id=SCCcredentials,src=/path/to/SCCcredentials \
    --secret=id=SUSEConnect,src=/path/to/SUSEConnect .
----

{podman}:

[source,Shell]
----
buildah bud --layers --secret=id=SCCcredentials,src=/path/to/SCCcredentials \
    --secret=id=SUSEConnect,src=/path/to/SUSEConnect .
----

[NOTE]
====
container-suseconnect runs automatically every time you invoke {zypper}. If you are not using a registered {slsa} host, you may see the following error message:

....
> zypper ref
Refreshing service 'container-suseconnect-zypp'.
Problem retrieving the repository index file for service 'container-suseconnect-zypp':
[container-suseconnect-zypp|file:/usr/lib/zypp/plugins/services/container-suseconnect-zypp] 
Warning: Skipping service 'container-suseconnect-zypp' because of the above error.
....

Ignore the message, as it simply indicates that container-suseconnect was not able to retrieve your {scc} credentials, and thus could not add the full {slea} repositories. You still have full access to the `{slea}_{bcia}` repository, and can continue using the container as intended.
====

[[sec-bci-suseconnect-add-modules]]
==== Adding modules to a container or container image

`container-suseconnect` allows you to automatically add {slea} Modules to
a container or container image. What modules are added is determined by
the environment variable `ADDITIONAL_MODULES` that includes a
comma-separated list of the module names. In a `Dockerfile`, this
is done using the `ENV` directive as follows:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest
ENV ADDITIONAL_MODULES sle-module-desktop-applications,sle-module-development-tools

RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n in fluxbox && zypper -n clean
----


[[sec-bci-task-examples]]
==== Common patterns

Here are a few examples that can give you an idea how to accomplish certain tasks in a {bcia} compared to Debian.

Remove orphaned packages::
  * Debian: `apt-get autoremove -y`
  * {bcia}: Not required if you remove installed packages using the `zypper --non-interactive remove --clean-deps
           PACKAGE_NAME`
Obtain container's architecture::
  * Debian: `dpkgArch="$(dpkg --print-architecture | awk -F- '{
           print $NF }')"`
  * {bcia}: `arch="$(uname -p|sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')"`
Install packages required for compilation::
  * Debian: `apt-get install -y build-essential`
  * {bcia}: `zypper -n in gcc gcc-c++ make`
Verify GnuPG signatures::
  * Debian: `gpg --batch --verify
           SIGNATURE_URL
           FILE_TO_VERIFY`
  * {bcia}: `zypper -n in dirmngr; gpg --batch --verify
           SIGNATURE_URL
           FILE_TO_VERIFY; zypper -n remove
           --clean-deps dirmngr; zypper -n clean`

[[sec-bci-package-naming]]
==== Package naming conventions

{slea} package naming conventions differ from Debian, Ubuntu, and Alpine, and they are closer to those of RHEL. The main difference is that development packages of libraries (that is, packages containing headers and build description files) are named _PACKAGE-devel_ in {slea}, as opposed to _PACKAGE-dev_ as they are in Debian and Ubuntu. When in doubt, search for the package directly using the following command: `docker run --rm
    registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:OS_VERSION zypper
    search PACKAGE_NAME` (replace OS_VERSION with the appropriate service version number, for example: `15.3` or `15.4`).

[[sec-bci-gpg-keys]]
==== Adding GPG signing keys

Adding external repositories to a container or container image normally requires importing the GPG key used for signing the packages. This can be done with the `rpm --import KEY_URL` command. This adds the key to the RPM database, and all packages from the repository can be installed afterwards.

[[sec-getting-started-bci]]
=== Getting started with {bci}s

The {bcia}s are available as OCI-compatible container images directly from https://registry.suse.com[registry.suse.com] and can be used like any other container image. For example, using one of the general purpose containers:

....
> podman run --rm -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 grep '^NAME' /etc/os-release
NAME="{sles}"
....

Alternatively, you can use a {bcia} in `Dockerfile` as follows:

....
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4
RUN zypper -n in python3 && \
    echo "Hello Green World!" > index.html
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/python3", "-m", "http.server"]
EXPOSE 8000
....

You can then build container images using the `docker build .` or `buildah bud .` commands:

....
> docker build .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
