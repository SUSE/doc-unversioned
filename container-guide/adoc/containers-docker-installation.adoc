== Setting up {deng}

[[sec-preparation]]
=== Preparing the host

Prepare the host as described below. Before installing any {docker}-related packages, you need to enable the `Containers Module`:

[NOTE]
.Built-in {docker} orchestration support
====
Starting with {deng} 1.12, container orchestration is now an integral part of {deng}. Even though this feature is available in {sles}{nbsp}{productnumber}, it is not supported by SUSE and is only provided as a technology preview. Use K8S for container orchestration. For details, refer to the http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/[Kubernetes documentation].
====

==== Installing and configuring {deng}

. Install the `docker` package:
+
....
> sudo zypper install docker
....
+
. To automatically start the {docker} service at boot time:
+
....
> sudo systemctl enable docker.service
....
+
This also enables _docker.socket_.
+
. Open the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file. Search for the parameter `DOCKER_OPTS` and add `--insecure-registry
       ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_REGISTRY`.
+
.. Add CA certificates to the directory `/etc/docker/certs.d/REGISTRY_ADDRESS`:
+
....
> sudo cp CA /etc/pki/trust/anchors/
....
+
.. Copy the CA certificates to your system:
+
....
> sudo update-ca-certificates
....
+
. Start the {docker} service:
+
....
> sudo systemctl start docker.service
....
+
This also starts _docker.socket_.

The {docker} daemon listens on a local socket accessible only by the root user and by the members of the docker group. The docker group is automatically created during package installation.

To allow a certain user to connect to the local {docker} daemon, use the following command:

....
> sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -aG docker USERNAME
....

This allows the user to communicate with the local {docker} daemon.

=== Configuring the network

To give the containers access to the external network, enable the `ipv4 ip_forward` rule.

[[sec-docker-setup-net-docs]]
==== How {deng} interacts with iptables

To learn more about how containers interact with each other and the system firewall, see the https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/container-communication/[{docker} documentation].

It is also possible to prevent {deng} from manipulating `iptables`. See the https://docs.docker.com/network/iptables/#prevent-docker-from-manipulating-iptables[{docker} documentation].

[[sec-docker-storaged]]
=== Storage drivers

{deng} supports different storage drivers:

* vfs: This driver is automatically used when the {docker} host file system does not support copy-on-write. This driver is simpler than the others listed and does not leverage certain advantages of {deng} such as shared layers. It is a reliable but slow driver.
* devicemapper: This driver relies on the device-mapper thin provisioning module. It supports copy-on-write, so it leverages all the advantages of {deng}.
* btrfs: This driver relies on Btrfs to provide all the features required by {deng}. To use this driver, the `/var/lib/docker` directory must be on a Btrfs file system.

Since {sles}{nbsp}12 onward, the Btrfs file system is used by default, which forces {deng} to use the btrfs driver.

It is possible to specify what driver to use by changing the value of the DOCKER_OPTS variable defined in the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file. This can be done either manually or using {yast} by browsing to the _System > /etc/sysconfig Editor > System > Management > DOCKER_OPTS_ menu and entering the _-s storage_driver_ string.

For example, to force the usage of the devicemapper driver, enter the following text:

....
DOCKER_OPTS="-s devicemapper"
....

[IMPORTANT]
.Mounting `/var/lib/docker`
====
It is recommended to mount `/var/lib/docker` on a separate partition or volume. In case of file system corruption, this would leave the operating system running {deng} unaffected.

If you choose the Btrfs file system for `/var/lib/docker`, it is strongly recommended to create a subvolume for it. This ensures that the directory is excluded from file system snapshots. If you do not exclude `/var/lib/docker` from snapshots, the file system will likely run out of disk space soon after you start deploying containers. In addition, a rollback to a previous snapshot will also reset the {docker} database and images. For more information, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/html/SLES-all/cha-snapper.html#sec-snapper-setup-customizing-new-subvolume.

[[sec-docker-setup-updates]]
=== Updates

All updates to the `docker` package are marked as interactive (that is, no automatic updates) to avoid accidental updates that can break running container workloads. We recommend stopping all running containers before applying an update to {deng}.

To avoid data loss, we do not recommend having workloads rely on containers being start-able after an update to {deng}. Although it is technically possible to keep containers running during an update via the `--live-restore` option, experience has shown that such updates can introduce regressions. SUSE does not support this feature.
