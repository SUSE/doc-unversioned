=== Verifying containers

Signatures for images available through {suseregistry} are stored in the Notary. You can verify the signature of a specific image using the following command:

....
docker trust inspect --pretty registry.suse.com/suse/IMAGE:TAG
....

For example, the command `docker trust inspect --pretty
   registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest` verifies the signature of the latest SLE15 base image.

To automatically validate an image when you pull it, set the environment `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` to `1`. For example:

....
env DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest
....
