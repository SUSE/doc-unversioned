== Creating custom container images

To create a custom image, you need a base image of {sles}. You can use any of the pre-built {sles} images.

[[sec-download-prebuild-images]]
=== Pulling base {slsa} images

To obtain a pre-built base image for {slea}{nbsp}12 SP5 and later, use the following command:

....
> podman pull registry.suse.com/suse/IMAGENAME
....

For example, for {sles}{nbsp}15, the command is as follows:

....
> podman pull registry.suse.com/suse/sle15
....

For information on obtaining specific base images, refer to <<sec-bci-intro>>.

When the container image is ready, you can customize it as described in <<sec-customize-prebuild-images>>.

[[sec-customize-prebuild-images]]
=== Customizing {slsa} container images

[[sec-customize-repo-registration]]
=== Repositories and Registration

The pre-built images do not have any repositories configured and do not include any modules or extensions. They contain a https://github.com/SUSE/container-suseconnect[zypper service] that contacts either the {scc} or a {rmtool} ({rmt}) server, according to the configuration of the {sles} host that runs the container. The service obtains the list of repositories available for the product used by the container image. You can also directly declare extensions in your `Dockerfile`. For more information, see <<sec-container-suseconnect>>.

[NOTE]
.SLE_BCI repository
====
Starting with {slea}{nbsp}15{nbsp}SP3, the default base image includes the `SLE_BCI` repository. This repository is only used when a container is built or runs on a non-registered {slsa} host, or when registration credentials are not made available to the container. The repository provides a subset of {slea} packages useful for customizing {slsa} container images. The repository is available without any registration, and it is not supported.
====

You do not need to add any credentials to the container image, because the machine credentials are automatically injected into the `/run/secrets` directory in the container by the docker daemon. The same applies to the `/etc/SUSEConnect` file of the host system, which is automatically injected into the `/run/secrets` directory.

[NOTE]
.Credentials and security
====
The contents of the `/run/secrets` directory are never included in a container image, hence there is no risk of your credentials leaking.
====

[[note-build-images-different-codebase]]
[NOTE]
.Building images on systems registered with {rmt}
====
When the host system used for building container images is registered with {rmt}, the default behavior allows only building containers of the same code base as the host. For example, if your container host is an {slea}{nbsp}15 system, you can only build {slea}{nbsp}15-based images on that host by default. To build images for a different {slea} version, for example, {slea}{nbsp}12 on an {slea}{nbsp}15 host, the host machine credentials for the target release can be injected into the container as outlined below.

Note that if the {rmt} server is using a self-signed certificate, the matching CA certificate needs to be added into the container at `CA_TRUSTSTORE/rmt-server.pem` for the certificate to be accepted.

When the host system is registered with {scc}, this restriction does not apply.
====

To obtain the list of repositories, use the following command:

....
> sudo zypper repos
....

This automatically adds all the repositories to the container. For each repository added to the system, a new file is created under `/etc/zypp/repos.d` . The URLs of these repositories include an access token that automatically expires after 12 hours. To renew the token, run the command `zypper ref -s` . Including these files in a container image does not pose any security risk.

To use a different set of credentials, put a custom `/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials` file inside the container image. It contains the machine credentials that have the subscription you want to use. The same applies to the `SUSEConnect` file: to override the existing file on the host system running the container, add a custom `/etc/SUSEConnect` file inside the container image.

Now you can create a custom container image by using a `Dockerfile` as described in <<sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-sles12sp3>>.

After you have edited the `Dockerfile`, build the image by running the following command in the same directory in which the `Dockerfile` resides:

....
> podman build .
....

For more information about `podman build` options, see the https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-build.1.html[official Podman documentation] .

[[sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-sles12sp3]]
=== Creating a custom image for {slea}{nbsp}12 SP5 and later

The following `Dockerfile` creates a simple container image based on {sles}{nbsp}15:

....
FROM registry.suse.com/suse/sle15
RUN zypper ref -s && zypper -n in vim && zypper -n clean
....

When the {podman} host machine is registered with an internal {rmt} server, the image requires the SSL certificate used by {rmt}:

....
FROM registry.suse.com/suse/sle15
# Import the crt file of our private SMT server
ADD http://smt./smt.crt /etc/pki/trust/anchors/smt.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates && \
    zypper ref -s && \
    zypper -n in vim && \
    zypper -n clean
....

If you wish to add SLE extensions and modules to your images, please refer to: <<sec-container-suseconnect-modules>>

[[sec-building-public-cloud]]
=== Building container images in on-demand {slea} instances in the public cloud
Building container images on {slea} instances that were launched as on-demand or pay-as-you-go instances on a public cloud (AWS, GCE, or Azure) requires additional steps. To install packages and updates, the on-demand public cloud instances are connected to the update infrastructure. This infrastructure is based on {rmt} servers operated by {suse} on public cloud providers.

Therefore, your machines need to locate the required services and authenticate with them. This can be done using the `containerbuild-regionsrv` service. This service is available in the public cloud images provided through the marketplaces of public cloud providers. Before building an image, this service must be started on the public cloud instance by running the following command:

....
> sudo systemctl start containerbuild-regionsrv
....

To start it automatically on system start-up, enable it:

....
> sudo systemctl enable containerbuild-regionsrv
....

The Zypper plug-ins provided by the {slea} base images connect to this service and retrieve authentication details and information about which update server to talk to. For this to work, the container has to be built with host networking enabled, for example:

....
> podman build --network host build-directory/
....

Since update infrastructure in the public clouds is based upon {rmt}, the restrictions on building {slea} images for {slea} versions different from the {slea} version of the host apply as well (see <<note-build-images-different-codebase>>).

[[sec-building-app-images]]
== Creating application images

Applications that are suitable for running inside containers include daemons, Web servers, and
applications that expose IP ports for communications. You can use {podman} to automate the building
and deployment processes by performing the build process inside a container, building an image, and
then deploying containers based on the image.

Running an application inside a container has the following advantages:

* The image with the application is portable across servers running different Linux host
distributions and versions.
* You can share the image of the application using a repository.
* You can use different versions of software in the container and on the host system, without
creating dependency issues.
* You can run multiple instances of the same application that are independent from each other.

Using {podman} to build applications has the following advantages:

* You can prepare an image of the complete build environment.
* The application can run in the same environment it was built in.
* Developers can test their code in the same environment as used in production.

The following section provides examples and recommendations on creating container images for
applications. Before proceeding, make sure that you have activated your {sles} base image as
described in <<sec-download-prebuild-images>>.

[[sec-application-with-specific-dependencies]]
=== Running an application with specific package versions

If your application needs a version of a package different from the package installed on the system,
you can create a container image that includes the package version the application requires. The
following example `Dockerfile` allows building an image based on an up-to-date version of {sles}
with an older version of the `example` package:

....
FROM registry.suse.com/suse/sle15
LABEL maintainer=EXAMPLEUSER_PLAIN
RUN zypper ref && zypper in -f example-1.0.0-0
COPY application.rpm /tmp/
RUN zypper --non-interactive in /tmp/application.rpm
ENTRYPOINT ["/etc/bin/application"]
CMD ["-i"]
....

Build the image by running the following command in the directory that the `Dockerfile` resides in:

....
> podman build --tag tux_application:latest .
....

The `Dockerfile` example shown above performs the following operations during the `podman build`:

[arabic]
. Updates the {sles} repositories.
. Installs the desired version of the `example` package.
. Copies the application package to the image. The binary RPM must be placed in the build context.
. Unpacks the application.
. The last two steps run the application after a container is started.

After a successful build of the `tux_application` image, you can start a container based on the new
image using the following command:

....
> podman run -it --name application_instance tux_application:latest
....

Keep in mind that after closing the application, the container exits as well.

[[sec-applications-with-configuration]]
=== Running an application with a specific configuration

To run an instance using a different configuration, create a derived image and include the
additional configuration with it. In the example below, an application called _example_ is
configured using the file `/etc/example/configuration_example`:

....
FROM registry.suse.com/suse/sle15 <1>
RUN zypper ref && zypper --non-interactive in example <2>
ENV BACKUP=/backup <3>
RUN mkdir -p $BACKUP <4>
COPY configuration_example /etc/example/ <5>
ENTRYPOINT ["/etc/bin/example"] <6>
....

The above example `Dockerfile` performs the following operations:

<1> Pulls the `sle15` base image as described in <<sec-download-prebuild-images>>.
<2> Refreshes repositories and installations of the _example_.
<3> Sets a `BACKUP` environment variable (the variable persists to containers started from the image). You can always overwrite the value of the variable while running the container by specifying a new value.
<4> Creates the directory `/backup`.
<5> Copies the `configuration_example` to the image.
<6> Runs the `example` application.

[[sec-run-application-with-volumes]]
=== Sharing data between an application and the host system

{podman} allows sharing data between host and a container by using _volumes_. You can specify a mount point directly in the `Dockerfile`. However, you cannot specify a directory on the host system in the `Dockerfile`, as the directory may not be accessible at build time. Find the mounted directory under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on the host system.

[NOTE]
.Discarding changes to the directory to be shared
====
After you specify a mount point by using the `VOLUME` instruction, all changes made to the directory with the `RUN` instruction are discarded. After the mount point is specified, the volume becomes a part of a temporary container, which is removed after a successful build. This means that for certain actions to take effect, they must be performed *before* specifying a mount point. For example, if you need to change permissions, do this before you specify the directory as a mount point in the `Dockerfile`.
====

Specify a particular mount point on the host system when running a container by using the `-v` option:

....
> podman run -it --name testing -v /home/tux/data:/data sles12sp4:latest /bin/bash
....

[NOTE]
====
The `-v` option overwrites the `VOLUME` instruction if you specify the same mount point in the container.
====

The following `Dockerfile` example builds an image containing a Web server that reads Web content from the host's file system:

....
FROM registry.suse.com/suse/sles12sp4
RUN zypper ref && zypper --non-interactive in apache2
COPY apache2 /etc/sysconfig/
RUN chown -R admin /data
EXPOSE 80
VOLUME /data
ENTRYPOINT ["apache2ctl"]
....

The example above installs the Apache Web server to the image and copies the entire configuration to the image. The `data` directory is owned by the _admin_ user and is used as a mount point to store Web pages.

[[sec-docker-daemons]]
=== Applications running in the background

If your application needs to run in the background as a daemon, or as an application exposing ports for communication, you can run the container in the background.

An example `Dockerfile` for an application exposing a port is as follows:

[[ex-docker-dockerfile-apache2]]
....
FROM registry.suse.com/suse/sle15 <1>
LABEL maintainer=EXAMPLEUSER_PLAIN <2>
ADD etc/ /etc/zypp/ <3>
RUN zypper refs && zypper refresh <4>
RUN zypper --non-interactive in apache2 <5> 
RUN echo "The Web server is running" > /srv/www/htdocs/test.html <6>
# COPY data/* /srv/www/htdocs/ <7>
EXPOSE 80 <8>
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/httpd"]
CMD ["-D", "FOREGROUND"]
....

<1> Pull the base image as described in <<sec-download-prebuild-images>>.
<2> Maintainer of the image (optional).
<3> The repositories and service files to be copied to `/etc/zypp/repos.d` and `/etc/zypp/services.d`. This makes them available on the host in the container.
<4> Command to refresh repositories and services.
<5> Command to install Apache2.
<6> Test line for debugging purposes. This line can be removed if everything works as expected.
<7> A `COPY` instruction to copy data from the host system to the directory in the container used by the server. The leading hash character ( `#` ) marks this line as a comment; it is not executed.
<8> The exposed port for the Apache Web server.

NOTE: To use port 80, make sure there is no other server software running on this port on the host.

To use the container, proceed as follows:

. Prepare the host system for the build process.

.. Make sure the host system is subscribed to the Server Applications Module of {sles}. To view installed modules or install additional modules, open {yast} and select Add System Extensions or Modules.

.. Make sure the {slea} images from the {suseregistry} are installed as described in <<sec-download-prebuild-images>>.

.. Save the `Dockerfile` in the `docker` directory.

.. Within the container, you need access to software repositories and services that are registered on the host. To make them available, copy repositories and service files from the host to the `docker/etc` directory:
+
....
> cd docker
> mkdir etc
> sudo cp -a /etc/zypp/{repos.d,services.d} etc/
....
+
Instead of copying all repository and service files, you can also copy only the subset that is required by the container.

.. Add Web site data (such as HTML files) into the `docker/data` directory. The contents of this directory are copied to the container image and are thus published by the Web server.

. Build the container. Set a tag for your image with the `-t` option (in the command below, it is `EXAMPLEUSER_PLAIN/apache2`):
+
....
> docker build -t EXAMPLEUSER_PLAIN/apache2 .
....
+
{deng} executes the instructions provided in the `Dockerfile`: pull the base image, copy content, refresh repositories, install the Apache2, etc.

. Start a container instance from the image created in the previous step:
+
....
> docker run --detach --interactive --tty EXAMPLEUSER_PLAIN/apache2
....
+
{deng} returns the container ID, for example:
+
....
7bd674eb196d330d50f8a3cfc2bc61a243a4a535390767250b11a7886134ab93
....
+
. Point a browser to http://localhost:80/test.html . You should see the message _The Web server is running_.

. To see an overview of running containers, run the `docker ps --latest` command:
+
....
> docker ps --latest
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  [...]
7bd674eb196d
tux/apache2         "/usr/sbin/httpd -..."   [...]
....
+
To stop and delete the container, run the following command:
+
....
> docker rm --force 7bd674eb196d
....

You can use the resulting container to serve your data with the Apache2 Web server by following these steps:

. In the `Dockerfile` :
+
* In the example `Dockerfile`, comment the line that starts with `RUN echo` by adding a `#` character at its beginning.
* In the example `Dockerfile`, uncomment the line starting with `COPY` by removing the leading `#` character.
+
. Rebuild the image.

. Run the image in detached mode:
+
....
> docker run --detach --interactive --tty EXAMPLEUSER_PLAIN/apache2
....
+
{deng} responds with the container ID, for example:
+
....
e43fff4ae9832ecdb7677c058a73039d7610c32145a1d9b6ad0a4ed52b5c4dc7
....

To view the published data, point a browser at http://localhost:80/test.html .

To avoid copying Web site data into the container, share a directory of the host with the container. For more information, see https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/ .
