== Introduction to Linux containers

Linux containers offer a lightweight virtualization method to run multiple isolated virtual
environments simultaneously on a single host. This technology is based on the Linux kernel's
namespaces for process isolation and kernel control groups (cgroups) for resource (CPU, memory,
disk I/O, network, etc) management.

Unlike Xen and KVM, where a full guest operating system is executed through a virtualization layer,
Linux containers share and directly use the host OS kernel.

Advantages of using containers::
* *Size*: Container images should only include the content needed to run an application, whereas a
virtual machine include an entire operating system,
* *Performance*: Containers provide near-native performance, as the kernel overhead is lower compared
to virtualization and emulation.
* *Security*: Containers make it possible to isolate applications in self-contained units from the
rest of the host system.
* *Resources management*: It is possible to fine grained control CPU, memory, disk I/O, network
interfaces, etc inside containers (cgroups).
* *Flexibility*: Container images hold all necessary libraries, dependencies, and files needed to run
an application, thus can be easily developed and deployed on multiple hosts.

Limitations of containers::
* Containers share the host system's kernel, so the containers have to use the specific kernel
version provided by the host.
* Only Linux-based applications can be containerized on a Linux host.
* A container encapsulates binaries for a specific architecture ({x64} or {aarch64} for instance).
So a container made for {x64} only runs on a {x64} system host.
* Containers in themselves are no more secure than executing binaries outside of a container, and 
the overall security of containers depends on the host system. While containerized applications can
be secured through AppArmor or SELinux profiles, container security requires putting in place tools and
policies that ensure security of the container infrastructure and applications.

=== Key concepts and introduction to {podman}

Although {deng} is a popular choice for working with images and containers, {podman} provides a
drop-in replacement for {docker} that offers several advantages. While <<cha-podman-overview>>
provides more information on {podman}, this chapter offers a quick introduction to key concepts and
a basic procedure for creating a container image and using it to run a container.

The basic {podman} workflow is as follows:

Running a container, either on a local machine or cloud service, normally involves the following
steps:

[arabic]
. Fetch a base image by pulling it from a registry to your local machine.
. Create a `Dockerfile` and use it to build a custom image on top of the base image.
. Use the created image to start one or more containers.

To run a container, you need an image. An image includes all dependencies needed to run
the application. For example, the {slea} {bcia}-Base image contains the {slea} distribution with a
minimal package selection.

While it is possible to create an image from scratch, few applications would work in such an empty
environment. Thus, using an existing base image is more practical in most situations. A base image
has no parent, meaning it is not based on another image.

Although you can use a base image for running containers, the main purpose of base images is to
serve as foundations for creating custom images that can run containers with specific applications,
servers, services, and so on.

Both base and custom images are usually available through a repository of images called a registry.
Unless a registry is explicitly specified, {podman} pulls images from the
https://registry.opensuse.org[openSUSE] and  https://docker.io[{dhub}] registry. While you can
fetch a base image manually, {podman} can do that automatically when building a custom image.

To build a custom image, you must create a special file called a `Containerfile` or `Dockerfile`
containing building instructions. For example, a `Dockerfile` can contain instructions to update the
system software, install the desired application, open specific network ports, run commands, etc.

You can build images not only from base images, but also on top of custom images. So you can have an
image consisting of multiple layers. Please refer to <<cha-building-images>> for more information.
