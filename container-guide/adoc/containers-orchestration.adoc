== Container orchestration

[[sec-orchestration-introduction]]
=== Introduction
Now that you have a better understanding of how to handle containers on your desktop or server, we
can go to the next step: How to make use of containers in production?
In a production environment you will likely have to manage multiple containers, be it locally on
your single container host or on multiple Container Host. To manage multiple containers, you will
have to group your containers (one or more) into a Pod, which will allow them to share storage and
network resources but also a specification for how to be deployed and run. In short a pod
encapsulates an application composed of multiple containers into a single unit. The pod concept was
introduced by https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/[Kubernetes] however Podman, which
stand for Pod Manager, uses the same definition as Kubernetes. 

[[sec-orchestration-podman]]
=== Single Container Host with Podman

[[sec-orchestration-architecture]]
==== Architecture
A pod is a group of containers that share the same name space, ports, and network connection.
Usually, containers within one pod can communicate directly with each other. Each pod contains an
infrastructure container (INFRA), whose purpose is to hold the name space. INFRA also enables Podman
to add other containers to the pod. Port bindings, cgroup-parent values, and kernel name spaces are
all assigned to the infrastructure container. Therefore, later changes of these values are not
possible.

image::pods_architecture.png[image,scaledwidth=80.0%]

Each container in a pod has its own instance of a monitoring program. The monitoring program watches
the container's process and if the container dies, the monitoring program saves its exit code. The
program also holds open the tty interface for the particular container. The monitoring program
enables you to run containers in the detached mode when Podman exits, because this program continues
to run and enables you to attach tty later.

[[sec-orchestration-podman-pod]]
==== Podman pod
podman pod is the command line tool for creating, removing, querying and inspecting pods. You can
check all the subcommands of podman pod in the
https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-pod.1.html[official upstream documentation]. 

[[sec-orchestration-pod-create]]
==== Create and list pods
podman pod create will create a pod with a random name, but you can use the --name parameter to
assign the desired name to a pod.

....
# podman pod create
344940492c00b6a19ececbc5b109351bf0a3b8b19b3c279a097da7a653c592d0
....

you can list our pods using the podman pod list command:

....
# podman pod list
POD ID        NAME          STATUS      CREATED        INFRA ID      # OF CONTAINERS
344940492c00  suspicious_curie  Created     2 minutes ago  617d7e3ce399  1
....

You can also list all containers with the pods they are associated with:
....
# podman ps -a --pod
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                 COMMAND     CREATED        STATUS      PORTS       NAMES               POD ID        PODNAME
617d7e3ce399  localhost/podman-pause:4.3.1-1669118400              5 minutes ago  Created                 344940492c00-infra  344940492c00  suspicious_curie
....

The created pod has an infra container identified by the `localhost/podman-pause:4.x` name. The
purpose of this container is to reserve the namespaces associated with the pod and allow {podman} to
add other containers to the pod.

[[sec-orchestration-pod-add]]
==== Run and add a container to a pod
Using the podman run --pod command, you can run a container and add it to the desired pod. For
example, the command below runs a container based on the suse/sle15 image and adds the container to
the `suspicious_curie` pod: 

....
# podman run -d --pod suspicious_curie registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base sleep 1h
8f5af62a7c385bbd1a3a5cc3a53a8d0f8cf942adc26a065960d4232fcc93ac98
....

WARNING: If this command shows the following warning, please refer
http://https//documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/#sec-bci-suseconnect-podman-buildah-nerdctl[Using container-suseconnect on non-SLE hosts or with Podman, Buildah, and nerdctl]: 
....
WARN[0005] Path "/etc/SUSEConnect" from "/etc/containers/mounts.conf" doesn't exist, skipping 
WARN[0005] Failed to mount subscriptions, skipping entry in /etc/containers/mounts.conf: open /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials: permission denied
....

The command above adds a container that sleeps for 60 minutes and then exits. Run the podman ps -a
--pod command again and you should see that the pod now has two containers.

You can also check the command podman pod ps:
....
# podman pod ps
POD ID        NAME          STATUS      CREATED         INFRA ID      # OF CONTAINERS
344940492c00  suspicious_curie Running     21 minutes ago  617d7e3ce399  2
....

[[sec-orchestration-pod-stop]]
==== Stoping pod or a container in a pod

Let's stop our newly created container named objective_jemison

....
# podman ps -a --pod

You can also stop the pod and all of its containers using, podman pod stop

....
# podman pod stop suspicious_curie
344940492c00b6a19ececbc5b109351bf0a3b8b19b3c279a097da7a653c592d0

....

Of course you can also start and restart everything with sudo podman start yourcontainername,
 podman pod start yourpodname or podman pod restart yourpodname.

[[sec-orchestration-pod-rm]]
==== Removing pods
There are two ways to remove pods. You can use the `podman pod rm` command to remove one or more pods.
Alternatively, you can remove all stopped pods using the `podman pod prune` command.
To remove a pod or several pods, run the `podman pod rm` command as follows:

....
# podman pod rm POD
....

POD can be a pod name or a pod ID.
To remove all currently stopped pods, use the `podman pod prune` command. Make sure that all stopped
pods are intended to be removed before you run the `podman pod prune` command, otherwise you might
remove pods that are still in use.

[[sec-orchestreation-podman-systemd]]
==== Creating systemd units for a pod

A container runtime makes it easy to launch an application distributed as a
single container. But things get more complicated when you need to run
applications consisting of multiple containers, or when it's necessary to start
the applications automatically on system boot and restart them after they
crash. While container orchestration tools like Kubernetes are designed for that
exact purpose, they are intended to be used for highly distributed and scalable
systems with hundreds of nodes, and not for a single machine. systemd and Podman
are much better suited for the single-machine scenario, as they do not add
another layer complexity to your existing setup.

===== Overview

Starting with version 1.3.0, Podman supports creating systemd unit files with
the `podman generate systemd` subcommand. The subcommand creates a systemd unit
file, making it possible to control a container or pod via systemd. Using the
unit file you can launch a container or pod on boot, automatically restart it if
a failure occurs, and keep its logs in journald.


===== Creating a new Systemd Unit File

The following example uses a simple NGINX container:

....
❯ podman run -d --name web -p 8080:80 docker.io/nginx
c0148d8476418a2da938a711542c55efc09e4119909aea70e287465c6fb51618
....

Generating a systemd unit for the container can be done as follows:
....
❯ podman generate systemd --name --new web
# container-web.service
# autogenerated by Podman 4.2.0
# Tue Sep 13 10:58:54 CEST 2022

[Unit]

        --rm \
        --sdnotify=conmon \
        --replace \
        -d \
        --name web \
        -p 8080:80 docker.io/nginx

Podman outputs a unit file to the console that can be put either into the user
unit systemd directories (`~/.config/systemd/user/` or `/etc/systemd/user/`) or
into the system unit systemd directory (`/etc/systemd/systtem`) and control the
container via systemd. The `--new` flag instructs Podman to recreate the
container on a restart. This ensures that the systemd unit is self-contained,
and it does not depend on external state. The `--name` flag allows you to assign
a user-friendly name to the container: without it Podman uses container IDs
instead of their names.

To control the container as a user unit, proceed as follows:

....
❯ podman generate systemd --name --new --files web
/home/user/container-web.service
❯ mv container-web.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
❯ systemctl --user daemon-reload
....

Now the container can be started via `systemctl --user start container-web`:

....
❯ systemctl --user start container-web
❯ systemctl --user is-active container-web.service
active
....

Run the `podman ps` command to see the list of all running containers :

....
❯ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                 NAMES
af92743971d2  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  15 minutes ago  Up 15 minutes ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  web
....


One of the benefits of managing the container via systemd is the ability to
automatically restart the container if it crashes. You can simulate a crash by
sending `SIGKILL` to the main process in the container:

....
❯ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                 NAMES
4c89582fa9cb  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  About a minute ago  Up About a minute ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  web

❯ kill -9 $(podman inspect --format "{{.State.Pid}}" web)

❯ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS            PORTS                 NAMES
0b5be4493251  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  4 seconds ago  Up 4 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  web
....

Note that the container is *not* restarted when it is stopped gracefully,
e.g. via `podman stop web`. To always restart it, add the flag
`--restart-policy=always` to `podman generate systemd`.

=== Updating container images

Using the described approach means that the container image is never
updated. You can solve the problem by adding the `--pull=always` flag to the
`ExecStart=` entry in the unit file. But be aware that this increases the
startup time of the container and updates the image on *every* restart. The
latter also means that a container image update can make the container
unavailable outside of a scheduled maintenance window due to a newly
introduced bug.


The
https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-auto-update.1.html[`auto-update`]
subcommand in Podman provides a possible solution. Add the label
`io.containers.autoupdate=registry` to a container to make Podman pull a new
version of the container image from the registry when running `podman
auto-update`. This makes it possible to update all container images with a
single command at a desired time, and without increasing the startup time of the
systemd units.

The auto update feature can be enabled by adding the line `--label
"io.containers.autoupdate=registry" \` to the `ExecStart=` entry of the
container's systemd unit file. for the NGINX example, modify
`~/.config/systemd/user/container-web.service` as follows:

....
ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run \
        --cidfile=%t/%n.ctr-id \
        --cgroups=no-conmon \
        --rm \
        --sdnotify=conmon \
        --replace \
        -d \
        --name web \
        --label "io.containers.autoupdate=registry" \
        -p 8080:80 docker.io/nginx
....


After reloading the daemons and restarting the container, perform a dry
run of the update (it will most likely not report any updates):

....
❯ podman auto-update --dry-run
UNIT                   CONTAINER           IMAGE            POLICY      UPDATED
container-web.service  87d263489307 (web)  docker.io/nginx  registry    false
....

It is good practice to have external testing in place to make sure that image
updates are generally safe to be deployed. If you are confident in the quality
of our container image, you can let Podman automatically apply image updates
periodically by enabling the `podman-auto-update.timer`:

....
# just for the current user
❯ systemctl --user enable podman-auto-update.timer
Created symlink /home/user/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/podman-auto-update.timer → /usr/lib/systemd/user/podman-auto-update.timer.
# or as root
❯ sudo systemctl enable podman-auto-update.timer
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/podman-auto-update.timer → /usr/lib/systemd/system/podman-auto-update.timer.
....

=== Managing multiple containers

Certain applications rely on more than one container to function, for example a
web frontend, a backend server and a
database. https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker compose] is popular tool for
deploying multi-container applications on a single machine. While Podman does
not support the `compose` command natively, in most cases compose files can be
ported to a Podman pod and multiple containers.

The following example deploys a Drupal and PostgreSQL container in a single pod
and manages these via systemd units. First, create a new pod that exposes the
Drupal web interface:

....
❯ podman pod create -p 8080:80 --name drupal
736cab072c49e68ad368ba819e9117be13ef8fa048a2eb88736b5968b3a19a64
....

Once the pod has been created, launch the Drupal frontend and the
PostgreSQL database inside it:

....
❯ podman run -d --name drupal-frontend --pod drupal docker.io/drupal
ffd2fbd6d445e63fb0c28abb8d25ced78f819211d3bce9d6174fe4912d89f0ca

❯ podman run -d --name drupal-pg --pod drupal \
      -e POSTGRES_DB=drupal \
      -e POSTGRES_USER=user \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass \
      docker.io/postgres:11
a4dc31b24000780d9ffd81a486d0d144c47c3adfbecf0f7effee24a00273fcde
....

This results in three running containers: the Drupal web interface, the
PostgreSQL database and the pod's infrastructure container.

....
❯ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                    COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                 NAMES
2948fa1476c6  localhost/podman-pause:4.2.0-1660228937                        2 minutes ago       Up About a minute ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  736cab072c49-infra
ffd2fbd6d445  docker.io/library/drupal:latest          apache2-foregroun...  About a minute ago  Up About a minute ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  drupal-frontend
a4dc31b24000  docker.io/library/postgres:11            postgres              40 seconds ago      Up 41 seconds ago      0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  drupal-pg
....

Creating a systemd unit for the pod is done similar to a
single container:
[source,Shell]
....
❯ podman generate systemd --name --new --files drupal
/home/user/pod-drupal.service
/home/user/container-drupal-frontend.service
/home/user/container-drupal-pg.service
❯ mv *service ~/.config/systemd/user/
❯ systemctl daemon-reload --user
....

Since Podman is aware of which containers belong to the `drupal` pod and how
their systemd units are called, it can correctly add the dependencies to the
pod's unit file. This means that when you start or stop the pod, systemd ensures
that all containers inside the pod are started or stopped automatically.

To check systemd's dependency handling, first stop the `drupal` pod and verify
that no containers are currently running on the host:

....
❯ podman pod stop drupal
736cab072c49e68ad368ba819e9117be13ef8fa048a2eb88736b5968b3a19a64
❯ podman pod rm drupal
736cab072c49e68ad368ba819e9117be13ef8fa048a2eb88736b5968b3a19a64
❯ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
....

Start the `drupal` pod via `systemctl start --user pod-drupal.service`, and
systemd launches the containers inside the pod:

....
❯ systemctl start --user pod-drupal.service
❯ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                    COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS            PORTS                 NAMES
d1589d3ac68b  localhost/podman-pause:4.2.0-1660228937                        5 seconds ago  Up 5 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  ca41b505bd13-infra
a49bea53c20c  docker.io/library/postgres:11            postgres              4 seconds ago  Up 5 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  drupal-pg
dc9dca018dad  docker.io/library/drupal:latest          apache2-foregroun...  4 seconds ago  Up 5 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  drupal-frontend
....

=== Multi Container Host with Kubernetes

https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications. The open source project is hosted by the Cloud Native
Computing Foundation (https://www.cncf.io/about[CNCF]).

With its wide range of features and capabilities, supported by a large community of developers, Kubernetes has become
the go-to standard for most https://www.suse.com/suse-defines/definition/containers-service-caas/[container-as-a-service] platforms. It 
provides an extensive set of functionalities essential for deploying containers at the production level, 
including high availability, lifecycle management, storage, security, and networking.

[[sec-k8s]]
==== Kubernetes (k8s)
Kubernetes allows multiple machines (or servers or nodes) to work together and create a cluster, which you can
then interact with using APIs. There are many tools available to deploy a Kubernetes cluster, but 
at SUSE, we recommend using https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com[Rancher]. 
With Rancher, you can not only deploy a Kubernetes cluster but also manage applications running on top of it. Additionally, a 
single Rancher setup can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters running anywhere from bare-metal, on-prem, or cloud service providers, making it easier to manage your applications while taking off the burden of managing the 
machinery to deploy them.

We won't describe here how to install and use
https://www.rancher.com/products/rke[Rancher Kubernetes Engines (RKE)], as the
https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com[Rancher's documentation] does that perfectly.



[[sec-k3s]]
==== Lightweight Kubernetes (k3s)

https://k3s.io[K3s] is lightweight CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution, made by Rancher, and
built IoT & Edge computing. K3s differs from k8s as it is packaged as a single <60MB binary and
optimised for ARM.
