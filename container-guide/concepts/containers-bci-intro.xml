    <title>Introduction to &bci;s</title>
  </info>
  <para>
    &bci;s (&bcia;s) are minimal &slsa; 15-based images that you can use to
    develop, deploy and share applications. There are two types of &bcia;s:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        General-purpose &bcia;s can be used for building custom container
        images and for deploying applications.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Language stack &bcia;s provide minimal environments for developing and
        deploying applications in specific programming languages.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    &bci;s are available from the
    <link xlink:href="https://registry.suse.com">&suseregistry;</link>.
    It contains tested and updated &bci;s. All images in the &suseregistry;
    undergo a maintenance process. The images are built to contain the latest
    available updates and fixes. The &suseregistry;'s Web user interface lists
    a subset of the available images. For information about the &suseregistry;,
    see <xref linkend="sec-tools-suse-registry"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    &slea; base images in the &suseregistry; receive security updates and are
    covered by the &suse; support plans. For more information about these
    support plans, see <xref linkend="container-support"/>.

    <title>Why &bci;s</title>
    <para>
      &bcia;s offer a platform for creating &slsa;-based custom container
      images and containerized applications that can be distributed freely.
      &bcia;s feature the same predictable enterprise lifecycle as &slsa;. The
      SLE_BCI 15 SP3 and SP4 repository (which is a subset of the &slea;
      repository) gives &bcia;s access to 4000 packages available for the
      &x86-64;, &aarch64;, &power;, and &zseries; architectures. The packages in
      the repository have undergone quality assurance and security audits by
      &suse;. The container images are FIPS-compliant when running on a host in
      FIPS mode. In addition to that, &suse; can provide official support for
      &bcia;s through &suse; subscription plans.

          <para>
            Each package in the SLE_BCI repository undergoes security audits,
            and &bcia;s benefit from the same mechanism of dealing with CVEs as
            &suse; Linux Enterprise Server. All discovered and fixed
            vulnerabilities are announced via e-mail, the dedicated
            <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/security/cve/">CVE
            pages</link>, and as OVAL and CVRF data. To ensure a secure supply
            chain, all container images are signed with Notary v1, Podman's GPG
            signatures, and Sigstore Cosign.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Since &bcia;s are based on &slsa;, they feature the same level of
            stability and quality assurance. Similar to &slsa;, &bcia;s receive
            maintenance updates that provide bug fixes, improvements and
            security patches.

          <para>
            &bcia;s are designed to provide drop-in replacements for popular
            container images available on hub.docker.com. You can use the
            general-purpose &bcia;s and the tools they put at your disposal to
            create custom container images, while the language stack &bcia;s
            provide a foundation and the required tooling for building
            containerized applications.

            that allows you to redistribute custom container images based on a

        <para>
          &bcia;s are fully compatible with &slsa;, but
          <emphasis role="strong">they do not require a subscription to run and
          distribute them.</emphasis>

        <para>
          &bcia;s automatically run in FIPS-compatible mode when the host
          operating system is running in FIPS mode.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Each &bcia; includes the RPM database, which makes it possible to
          audit the contents of the container image. You can use the RPM
          database to determine the specific version of the RPM package any
          given file belongs to. This allows you to ensure that a container
          image is not susceptible to known and already fixed vulnerabilities.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          All &bcia;s (except for those without &zypper;) come with the
          <literal>container-suseconnect</literal> service. This gives
          containers that run on a registered &slsa; host access to the full
          &slsa; repositories. <literal>container-suseconnect</literal> is
          invoked automatically when you run &zypper; for the first time, and
          the service adds the correct &slsa; repositories into the running
          container. On an unregistered &slsa; host or on a non-&slsa; host,
          the service does nothing. See
          <xref linkend="sec-bci-suseconnect"/> for more information.

    <note>
      <title>SLE_BCI repository</title>
      <para>
        There is a SLE_BCI repository for each SLE service pack. This means
        that &bcia;s based on SP4 have access to the SLE_BCI repository for
        SP4, all &bcia;s based on SP5 use the SLE_BCI repository for SP5, and
        so on. Each SLE_BCI repository contains all SLE packages except
        kernels, boot loaders, installers (including YaST), desktop
        environments and hypervisors (such as KVM and Xen).
      </para>
    </note>
    <note>
      <title>Requesting a missing package</title>
      <para>
        If the SLE_BCI repository does not have a package you need, you have
        two options. As an existing &suse; customer, you can file a feature
        request. As a regular user, you can request a package to be created by
        creating an issue in
        <link xlink:href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=&suse;%20Linux%20Enterprise%20Base%20Container%20Images">Bugzilla</link>.
