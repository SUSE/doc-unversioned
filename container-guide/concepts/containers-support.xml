  <para>
    The term "support" refers to two distinct concepts: a) technical enablement
    of a feature or combination of, for example, host and container, and b)
    enterprise support as delivered by &suse; to &suse; customers. Enterprise
    support requires a subscription for &suse; products according to
    <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/terms_and_conditions.pdf"/>.
    Technical enablement is described below.

      <title>Limited support note</title>
      <para>
        &suse; provides limited support for &slsa; 15 GA-based containers
        running on &slsa; 12 SP5 hosts due to the fact that containerized
        applications can make system calls not available in the host's kernel.
        To avoid potential risks and compatibility problems, &suse; recommends
        using the same Service Pack release for both containers and hosts.

    <para>
      &bcia;s support the following architectures: &x86-64;, &aarch64;, &power;

      host. Mismatching container and host scenarios are not supported.
    </para>
    <para>
      In most scenarios, all &slea; containers are expected to be interoperable
      if the application and its dependencies do not interact directly with

      (KVM, OVS, SystemTap, etc.). Support for <literal>ioctl</literal> and

      Containers and host environments delivered by &suse; are fully supported.

    <para>
      Partner containers and host environments with a joint engineering

    <para>
      While &suse;-based containers are fully supported, issues in the host
      environment must be handled by the host environment vendor. &suse;

      from &suse; repositories are also supported. Additional components and
      applications in the containers are not covered by &suse; support. No
      subscription is required for building derived containers based on the
      content of the &bcia;s or the SLE_BCI Repository. To build
      containers that include packages from the full &slea; universe, you need
      a subscription that grants you access to the repositories containing
      these packages.

      Any container and host environment not mentioned above has limited
      support. Details can be discussed with the &suse; Support Team
