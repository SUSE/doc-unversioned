    The term "support" refers to two distinct concepts: a) technical enablement
    of a feature or combination of, for example, host and container, and b)
    enterprise support as delivered by &suse; to &suse; customers. Enterprise
    support requires a subscription for &suse; products according to
    <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/terms_and_conditions.pdf">https://www.suse.com/products/terms_and_conditions.pdf</link>.
    Technical enablement is described below.

      <title>Limited support note</title>
      <para>
        &suse; provides limited support for &slsa; PRODUCT-GA-based containers
        running on &slsa; 12 SP5 hosts due to the fact that containerized
        applications can make system calls not available in the host's kernel.
        To avoid potential risks and compatibility problems, &suse; recommends
        using the same Service Pack release for both containers and hosts.
      </para>
    </important>
    <para>
      &bcia;s support the following architectures: &x86-64;, &aarch64;, &power;
      and &zsystems;. Container architecture must match the architecture of the
      host. Mismatching container and host scenarios are not supported.
    </para>
    <para>
      In most scenarios, all &slea; containers are expected to be interoperable
      if the application or its dependencies do not interact directly with
      kernel version-specific data structures (<literal>ioctl</literal>,
      <literal>/proc</literal>, <literal>/sys</literal>,
