  <section xml:id="sec-tools-suse-registry">
    <title>&suseregistry;</title>
    <para>
      <link xlink:href="https://registry.suse.com"/> is the
      official source of &bci;s. It contains tested, updated
      and certified &bci;s. All images in the &suseregistry;
      are regularly rebuilt to include updates and fixes. The &suseregistry;'s
      Web user interface lists a subset of the available images: Base Container
      Images, Development Stack Container Images, Application Container Images, &sles; Images, and Releases Out of General Support.
      The Web UI also provides additional information for each image, including
      release date, support level, size, digest of the images and packages
      inside the image.

  <section xml:id="sec-tools-docker">
    <title>&docker;</title>
    <para>
      &docker; is a system for creating and managing containers. Its core is the
      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/moby/moby">&docker; Open Source
      Engine—</link>a lightweight virtualization solution to run containers
      simultaneously on a single host. &docker; containers can be built using
      Dockerfiles.

  <section xml:id="sec-tools-podman">
    <title>&podman;</title>
    <para>
      <link xlink:href="https://podman.io">&podman;</link> stands for Pod Manager
      tool. It is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing and
      running
      <link xlink:href="https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/">Open
      Container Initiative (OCI)</link> containers on a Linux system, and it
      offers a drop-in alternative for &docker;. &podman; is the recommended
      container runtime for SLES. For a general introduction to &podman;, refer
      to
      <xref linkend="container-podman"/>.

  <section xml:id="sec-tools-buildah">
    <title>&buildah;</title>
    <para>
      <link xlink:href="https://buildah.io">&buildah;</link> is a utility for
      building OCI container images. It is a complementary tool to &podman;. In
      fact, the <command>podman build</command> command uses &buildah; to
      perform container image builds. &buildah; makes it possible to build
      images from scratch, from existing images, and using Dockerfiles. OCI
      images built using the &buildah; command-line tool and the underlying
      OCI-based technologies (for example, <literal>containers/image</literal>
      and
      <literal>containers/storage</literal> ) are portable and can therefore
      run in a &deng; environment. For information on
      installing and using &buildah;, refer to
      <xref linkend="container-buildah"/>.

      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">skopeo</link> is
      a command-line utility for managing, inspecting and signing container
      images and image repositories. skopeo can be used to inspect containers
      and repositories on remote and local container registries. skopeo can
      copy container images between different storage back-ends. skopeo is part
      of the <literal>Basesystem Module</literal> of &sles;.

    <title>Helm</title>
    <para>
      <link xlink:href="https://helm.sh">Helm</link> is the Kubernetes package
      manager, and it is the de-facto standard for deploying containerized
      applications on Kubernetes clusters using charts. Helm can be used to install, update and remove containerized applications in Kubernetes environments. It can also handle the associated resources, such as
      configuration, storage volumes, etc. For instance, it is used for
      instance to deploy the &rmt; server (see
      <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/single-html/SLES-rmt/index.html#sec-rmt-deploy-kubernetes">&rmt;

      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/distribution/distribution">Distribution</link>
      is an open-source registry implementation for storing and distributing
      container images using the OCI Distribution Specification. It provides a
      simple, secure and scalable base for building a large scale registry
      solution or running a simple private registry. Distribution can also
      mirror &dhub; but

    <title>Open Build Service</title>
    <para>
      The <link xlink:href="https://openbuildservice.org">Open Build Service
      (OBS)</link> provides free infrastructure for building and storing RPM
      packages including different container formats. The
      <link xlink:href="https://registry.opensuse.org">OBS Container
      Registry</link> provides a detailed listing of all container images built
      by the OBS, complete with commands for pulling the images into your local
      environment. The OBS
      <link xlink:href="https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates">openSUSEcontainer
      image templates</link> can be modified to specific needs, which offers
      the easiest way to create your own container branch. Container images can
      be built with &docker; tools from an existing image using a
      <filename>Dockerfile</filename>. Alternatively, images can be built from
      scratch using the &kiwi; image-building solution.
    </para>
    <para>
      Instructions on how to build images on OBS can be found in the following
      <link xlink:href="https://openbuildservice.org/2018/05/09/container-building-and-distribution/">blog post</link>.

    <para>
      &suse; Container Images, called &bci;s
      (&bcia;s) are the only official container images. They are not available at
      <link xlink:href="https://build.opensuse.org"/>,
      and the RPMs exported there are not identical to the internal ones. This
      means that it is not possible to build supported images at
      <link xlink:href="https://build.opensuse.org"/>.

    <para>
      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi">KIWI</link> Next
      Generation (&kiwi;) is a multi-purpose tool for building images. In addition to
      container images, regular installation ISO images, and images for virtual
      machines, &kiwi; can build images that boot via PXE or Vagrant boxes. The
      main building block in &kiwi; is an image XML description, a directory that
      includes the <filename>config.xml</filename> or <filename>.kiwi</filename>
      file along with scripts or configuration data. The process of creating
      images with &kiwi; is fully automated and does not require any user
      interaction. Any information required for the image creation process is
      provided by the primary configuration file <filename>config.xml</filename>.
      The image can be customized using the <filename>config.sh</filename> and
      <filename>images.sh</filename> scripts. &kiwi; is the core engine of
      <link xlink:href="https://openbuildservice.org">Open Build Service
      (OBS)</link>.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        It is important to distinguish between &kiwi; (currently version
        9.20.9) and its unmaintained legacy versions (7.x.x or older), now
        called <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/kiwi/">KIWI
        Legacy</link>.
      </para>

      For information on how to install &kiwi; and use it to build
      images, see the <link xlink:href="https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/">&kiwi;
      documentation</link>. A collection of example image descriptions can be
      found on the
      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi-descriptions">&kiwi;
      GitHub repository</link>.
