    <title>Configuring image storage</title>
  </info>
  <para>
    Before creating custom images, decide where you want to store images. A
    simple solution is to push images to <link
    xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com">&dhub;</link>. By default, all images
    pushed to &dhub; are public. Make sure not to publish sensitive data or
    software not licensed for public use.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can restrict access to custom container images with the following:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        &dhub; allows creating private repositories for paid subscribers.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        An on-site &dreg; allows storing all the container images used by your
        organization.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    Instead of using &dhub; you can run a local instance of &dreg;, an open
    source platform for storing and retrieving container images.
  </para>

    <title>Running a &dreg;</title>
    <para>
      The &suseregistry; provides a container image that makes it possible to
      run a local &dreg; as a container. It stores the pushed images in a
      container volume corresponding to the directory
      <filename>/var/lib/docker-registry</filename>. It is recommended to
      either create a named volume for the registry or to bind mount a
      persistent directory on the host to
      <filename>/var/lib/docker-registry</filename> in the container. This
      ensures that pushed images persist deleting the container.
    </para>
    <para>
      Run the following command to pull the registry container image from the
      &suseregistry; and start a container that can be accessed on port 5000
      with the container storage bind mounted locally to
      <replaceable>/PATH/DIR/</replaceable>:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;podman run -d --restart=always --name registry -p 5000:5000 \
    -v /PATH/DIR:/var/lib/docker-registry registry.suse.com/suse/registry</screen>
    <para>
      Alternatively, create a named volume <replaceable>registry</replaceable>
      for the &suseregistry; container as follows:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;podman run -d --restart=always --name registry -p 5000:5000 \
     -v registry:/var/lib/docker-registry registry.suse.com/suse/registry</screen>
     <para>
      To make it easier to manage the registry, create a corresponding system
      unit:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user; podman generate systemd registry | \
     sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/suse_registry.service</screen>
    <para>
      Enable and start the registry service, then verify its status:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;sudo systemctl enable suse_registry.service
      &prompt.user;sudo systemctl start suse_registry.service
      &prompt.user;sudo systemctl status suse_registry.service</screen>
    <para>
      For more details about &dreg; and its configuration, see the official
      documentation at
      <link xlink:href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/"/>.
    </para>

    <title>Limitations</title>
    <para>
      &dreg; has two major limitations:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> It lacks any form of authentication. That means everybody with
        access to &dreg; can push and pull images to it. That includes
        overwriting existing images. It is recommended to setup some form of
        access restriction as described in the upstream documentation <link
        xlink:href="https://distribution.github.io/distribution/about/deploying/#restricting-access"/>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          It is not possible to see which images have been pushed to &dreg;.
          You need to keep a record of what is being stored on it. There is
          also no search functionality.
