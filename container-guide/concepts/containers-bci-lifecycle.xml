    <title>Important note on status and lifecycle &bci;s</title>
  </info>
  <para>
    All container images, except for base, are currently classified as tech
    preview, and &suse; does not provide official support for them. This
    information is visible on the web on
    <link xlink:href="https://registry.suse.com">registry.suse.com</link>. It
    is also indicated via the <literal>com.suse.supportlevel</literal> label
    whether a container image still has the tech preview status. You can use
    the skopeo and jq utilities to check the status of the desired &bcia; as
    follows:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-micro:15.4 | jq '.Labels["com.suse.supportlevel"]'
    "techpreview"
    
    &prompt.user;skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 | jq '.Labels["com.suse.supportlevel"]'
    "l3"</screen>
  <para>
    In the example above, the <literal>com.suse.supportlevel</literal> label is
    set to <literal>techpreview</literal> in the <literal>bci-micro</literal>
    container image, indicating that the image still has the tech preview
    status. The <literal>bci-base</literal> container image, on the other hand,
    has full L3 support. Unlike like the general purpose &bcia;s, the language
    stack &bcia;s may not follow the lifecycle of the &slsa; distribution: they
    are supported as long as the respective language stack receives support. In
    other words, new versions of &bcia;s (indicated by the OCI tags) may be
    released during the lifecycle of a &slsa; Service Pack, while older
    versions may become unsupported. Refer to
    <link xlink:href="https://suse.com/lifecycle"/> to find out whether the
    container in question is still under support.
  </para>
  <important>
    <para>
      A &bci; is no longer updated after its support period ends. You will not
      receive any notification when that happens.
