  <title>Support information</title>

  <para>
   The term "support" refers to two distinct concepts: a) technical enablement
   of a feature or combination of, for example, host and container, and b)
   enterprise support as delivered by &suse; to &suse; customers. Enterprise
   support requires a subscription for &suse; products according to
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/terms_and_conditions.pdf" />.
   Technical enablement is described below.

    <title>Limited support note</title>
    <para>
     &suse; provides limited support for &slsa; &product-ga;-based containers
     running on &slsa; 12 SP5 hosts due to the fact that containerized
     applications can make system calls not available in the host's kernel. To
     avoid potential risks and compatibility problems, &suse; recommends using
     the same Service Pack release for both containers and hosts.
    </para>
   </important>
   <para>
    &bci;s support the following architectures: &x86-64;, &aarch64;, &power;,
    and &zseries;. Container architecture must match the architecture of the
    host. Mismatching container and host scenarios are not supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    In most scenarios, all &slea; containers are expected to be interoperable
    if the application or its dependencies do not interact directly with kernel
    version-specific data structures (<literal>ioctl</literal>,
    <literal>/proc</literal>, <literal>/sys</literal>,
    <literal>routing</literal>, <literal>iptables</literal>,
    <literal>nftables</literal>, <literal>eBPF</literal>, etc.) or modules
    (KVM, OVS, SystemTap, etc.). Support for <literal>ioctl</literal> and
    access to <literal>/proc</literal> is limited to the most common scenarios
    needed by unprivileged users.

    While &suse;-based containers are fully supported, issues in the host

    components that are part of the &suse; base containers. Packages from

   There are three guiding principles of &suse; container support.

     The container image lifecycle follows the lifecycle of the related
     products.
    </para>

     For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images follow the &slsa;
     &productnumber; lifecycle.

    <para>
     Container release status also matches the status of the related product.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example, if &slsa; &productnumber; is in Alpha, Beta, RC, or GA stage,
     the related containers have the same release status.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Containers are built using the packages from the related products.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images are built using the
     same packages as the main &slsa; &productnumber; release.

   Container images can have different support status, and they can have
   limited support. Refer to the appropriate

  <title>Containers and host environments support overview</title>

  <para>
   The following support options are valid for &sls; containers on &suse; host
   environments.
  </para>

  <para>
   Containers and host environments delivered by &suse; are fully supported.
   This also applies to all products under support, including both general
   support and
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/long-term-service-pack-support/">Long
   Term Service Pack Support</link> (LTSS).
  </para>

  <para>
   Partner containers and host environments with a joint engineering
   collaboration agreement are fully supported. This applies to both the
   container and host environment as well as all products under support (both
   general and LTSS) covered by the agreement.
  </para>

  <para>
   While &suse;-based containers are fully supported, issues in the host
   environment must be handled by the host environment vendor. &suse; supports
   components that come from the &suse; base containers. Packages from &suse;
   repositories are also supported. Additional components and applications in
   the containers are not covered by &suse; support. No subscription is
   required for building derived containers based on the content of the &bci;s
   or the &bci; Repository. To build containers that include packages from the
   full &sle; universe, you need a subscription that grants you access to the
   repositories containing these packages.
  </para>

  <para>
   Any container and host environment not mentioned above has limited support.
   Details can be discussed with the &suse; Support Team, who might triage the
   issue and recommend alternative solutions. In any other case, issues in the
   host environment must be handled by the host environment vendor.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-tech-previews">
  <title>Technology previews</title>

  <para>
   Container images labeled as Tech Preview are provided by &suse; to give you
   an opportunity to test new technologies within your environment and share
   your feedback. If you test a technology preview, contact your &suse;
   representative to share your experiences and use cases. Your input is
   helpful for future development.
  </para>

  <para>
   Technology previews come with the following limitations:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews can be functionally incomplete, unstable, and not
     suitable for production use.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews are not supported.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews can be available only for specific hardware
     architectures.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Specifics and functionality of technology previews are subject to change.
     As a result, upgrading to subsequent releases of a technology preview may
     not be possible and may require a fresh installation.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews can be canceled at any time. For example, if &suse;
     discovers that a preview does not meet the customer or market needs, or it
     does not comply with enterprise standards. &suse; does not commit to
     providing a supported version of such technologies in the future.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Container images are labeled as <literal>Tech Preview</literal> and are
   marked as such at
   <link
xlink:href="https://registry.suse.com">registry.suse.com</link>.
   Additionally, container images that are technology previews include the
   <literal>com.suse.supportlevel="techpreview"</literal> label in the
   container image metadata. You can check whether the metadata includes the
   label using the <command>docker inspect</command> command, or an appropriate
   command in other container runtimes.
