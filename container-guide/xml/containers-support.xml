  <title>Support information</title>
<para>
  The term "support" refers to two distinct concepts: a) technical enablement of a feature or combination of, for example, host and container, and b) enterprise support as delivered by &suse; to &suse; customers. Enterprise support requires a subscription for &suse; products according to <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/terms_and_conditions.pdf" />. Technical enablement is described below.

   <title>Support for &slsa; hosts</title>
   <para>
    Containers are fully supported on the following conditions:

  <title>Newer container images on older hosts</title>
  <para>
    While it is technically possible to run a newer container image on an older container host, &suse; recommends upgrading the container host to avoid potential risks and compatibility problems.
  </para>
</important>
   <para>
    In most scenarios, all &slea; containers are expected to be interoperable
    if the application or its dependencies do not interact directly with kernel
    version-specific data structures (<literal>ioctl</literal>,
    <literal>/proc</literal>, <literal>/sys</literal>,
    <literal>routing</literal>, <literal>iptables</literal>,
    <literal>nftables</literal>, <literal>eBPF</literal>, etc.) or modules
    (KVM, OVS, SystemTap, etc.). Support for <literal>ioctl</literal> and
    access to <literal>/proc</literal> is limited to the most common scenarios
    needed by unprivileged users.

   <title>Support for non-&slsa; hosts</title>
   <para>
    While &suse;-based containers are fully supported, issues in the host
    environment must be handled by the host environment vendor. &suse; supports
    components that are part of the &suse; base containers. Packages from
    &suse; repositories are also supported. Additional components and
    applications in the containers are not covered by &suse; support. A &sle;
    subscription is required for building derived containers.

    Containers based on &sls; 12 SP5 and &sls; 15 (all service packs) are
    supported according to their official lifecycles and the following table.

  <para>
   There are three guiding principles of &suse; container support.
  </para>

  <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The container image lifecycle follows the lifecycle of the related
     products.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images follow the &slsa;
     &productnumber; lifecycle.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Container release status also matches the status of the related product.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example, if &slsa; &productnumber; is in Alpha, Beta, RC, or GA stage,
     the related containers have the same release status.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Containers are built using the packages from the related products.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images are built using the
     same packages as the main &slsa; &productnumber; release.
    </para>

   Lifecycle</link> page and the documentation available for specific container
   images on <link
 xlink:href="https://registry.suse.com">&suse;
   Registry</link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Container images can have different support status, and they can have
   limited support. Refer to the appropriate
   <link

   for the further information about a specific container image.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-supported-containers-hosts">
  <title>Containers and host environments support overview</title>

  <para>
   The following support options are valid for &sls; containers on &suse;
   host environments.
  </para>
      <para>
       Containers and host environments delivered by &suse; are fully supported.
       This also applies to all products under support, including both general
       support and
       <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/long-term-service-pack-support/">Long
       Term Service Pack Support</link> (LTSS).
      </para>
      <para>
        Partner containers and host environments with a joint engineering
        collaboration agreement are fully supported. This applies to both the
        container and host environment as well as all products under support
        (both general and LTSS) covered by the agreement.
      </para>

      <para>
        While &suse;-based containers are fully supported, issues in
        the host environment must be handled by the host environment vendor.
        &suse; supports components that come from the &suse; base containers.
        Packages from &suse; repositories are also supported. Additional
        components and applications in the containers are not covered by &suse;
        support. No subscription is required for building derived containers based on the content of the &bci;s or the &bci; Repository. To build containers that include packages from the full &sle; universe, you need a subscription that grants you access to the repositories containing these packages.
      </para>
      <para>
        Any container and host environment not mentioned above has limited
        support. Details can be discussed with the &suse; Support Team, who
        might triage the issue and recommend alternative solutions. In any other
        case, issues in the host environment must be handled by the host
        environment vendor.
       </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-tech-previews">
  <title>Technology previews</title>

  <para>
   Container images labeled as Tech Preview are provided by &suse; to give you
   an opportunity to test new technologies within your environment and share
   your feedback. If you test a technology preview, contact your &suse;
   representative to share your experiences and use cases. Your input is helpful
   for future development.
  </para>

  <para>
   Technology previews come with the following limitations:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews can be functionally incomplete, unstable, and not
     suitable for production use.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews are not supported.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews can be available only for specific hardware
     architectures.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Specifics and functionality of technology previews are subject to change.
     As a result, upgrading to subsequent releases of a technology preview may
     not be possible and may require a fresh installation.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Technology previews can be canceled at any time. For example, if &suse;
     discovers that a preview does not meet the customer or market needs, or it
     does not comply with enterprise standards. &suse; does not commit to
     providing a supported version of such technologies in the future.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Container images are labeled as <literal>Tech Preview</literal> and are marked as such at
   <link
xlink:href="https://registry.suse.com">registry.suse.com</link>.
   Additionally, container images that are technology previews include the
   <literal>com.suse.supportlevel="techpreview"</literal> label in the container
   image metadata. You can check whether the metadata includes the label using
   the <command>docker inspect</command> command, or an appropriate command in
   other container runtimes.
