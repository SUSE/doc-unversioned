== Rotating API keys

Communication from the {tragent} to the {trserver} is secured by a API
key that must be provided in the agent configuration file.

By default, the API key does not have an expiration date. You can set up
a custom expiration date to increase the overall security of the setup
and meet internal security requirements.

To do this, go to the *Settings* view and click the Generate Key button in
the API Key section:

Whenever a new key is generated, the configuration of all the reporting
agents must be updated accordingly.
