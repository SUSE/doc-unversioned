== Integration with {smlm}
:revdate: 2025-06-10


{trento} can be inegrated with {smlm} to provide the
{sap} administrator with information about relevant patches and
upgradable packages for any host that is registered with both
applications.

The user must enter the connection settings for {smlm}
in the Settings view:

.{smlm} settings

When the {smlm} settings are configured, the {sap}
Basis administrator can test the connection by clicking the Test button.
If the connection is successful, the *Host Details* view of each host
managed by {smlm} displays a summary of available
patches and upgradable packages:

.Available software updates in the Host Details view

Click *Relevant Patches* to view a list of patches available for the host:

.Available Patches overview

Click *Upgradable Packages* to view a list of packages that can be upgraded on that particular
host:

.Upgradable Packages overview

Click an advisory or patch link to access the corresponding details view
with relevant information, such us whether it requires a reboot or not,
associated vulnerabilities, or a list of affected hosts:

.Advisory Details view

There are three types of patches or advisories: security advisories, bug
fixes and feature enhancements. Security advisories are considered
critical. If an advisory is available, the health of the host is set to
critical. If there are available patches but none of them is a security
one, the health of the host switches to warning. When a host cannot be
found in {smlm}, or there is a problem retrieving the
data for it, its health is set to unknown.

You can clear the {smlm} settings from the Settings
view at any time. When you do this, all information about available
software updates disappears from the console, and the status of the
hosts is adjusted accordingly.
