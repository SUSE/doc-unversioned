== Product lifecycle and update strategy

Trento is available at no extra cost for {sles4sap} 15 subscribers. Particularly, Trento's two main components have the following product lifecycles:

// Variable List for tragent
{tragent}::
+
Delivery mechanism::: RPM package for {sles4sap} 15 SP3 and newer.

Supported runtime::: Supported in {sles4sap} 15 SP3 and newer on x86_64 and ppc64le architectures.

// Variable List for trserver
{trserver}::
+
Delivery mechanisms::: A set of container images from the {suse} public registry together with a Helm chart that facilitates their installation or a set of RPM packages for {sles4sap} 15 SP3 and newer.

{k8s} deployment::: The {trserver} runs on any current Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)-certified {k8s} distribution based on a x86_64 architecture. Depending on your scenario and needs, {suse} supports several usage scenarios:

* If you already use a CNCF-certified {k8s} cluster, you can run the {trserver} in it.
* If you don't have a {k8s} cluster, and need enterprise support, {suse} recommends {suse} Rancher.k8s.engine; (RKE) version 1 or 2.
* If you do not have a {k8s} enterprise solution but you want to try {trento}, {suse} Rancher's K3s provides you with an easy way to get started. But keep in mind that K3s default installation process deploys a single node {k8s} cluster, which is not a recommended setup for a stable Trento production instance.

systemd and containerized deployments::: Supported in {sles4sap} 15 SP3 and newer.
