== Updating {trserver}

The procedure to update {trserver} depends on the chosen deployment
option: {k8s}, systemd, or containerized.

Consider the following when performing an update:

* Before updating {trserver}, ensure that all the {tragent}s in the
environment are supported by the target version. For more information,
see section <<sec-trento-compatibility-matrix>>.
* When updating {trento} to version 2.4 or higher, the admin password
may need to be adjusted to follow the rules described in the User
Management section.

In a {k8s} deployment, you can use Helm to update {trserver}:

....
helm upgrade \
   --install trento-server oci://registry.suse.com/trento/trento-server \
   --set trento-web.trentoWebOrigin=TRENTO_SERVER_HOSTNAME \
   --set trento-web.adminUser.password=ADMIN_PASSWORD
        
....

If you have configured options like email alerting, the Helm command
must be adjusted accordingly. In this case, consider the following:

* Remember to set the helm experimental flag if you are using a version
of Helm lower than 3.8.0.
* When updating {trento} to version 2.0.0 or higher, an additional flag
must be set in the Helm command:
+
....
helm upgrade \
   --install trento-server oci://registry.suse.com/trento/trento-server \
   --set trento-web.trentoWebOrigin=TRENTO_SERVER_HOSTNAME \
   --set trento-web.adminUser.password=ADMIN_PASSWORD \
   --set rabbitmq.auth.erlangCookie=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
        
....
* When updating {trento} to version 2.3 or higher, a new API key is
generated and the configuration of all registered {tragent}s must be
updated accordingly.

In a system deployment, you can use zypper to update {trserver}:

....
 zypper refresh
 zypper update trento-web
 zypper update trento-wanda
 systemctl restart trento-web
 systemctl restart trento-wanda     
....

In a containerized deployment, you can use the same Docker commands as
for the installation. Keep in mind that the volume for the {trento}
checks already exists, so there is no need to create it. Also, the web
and wanda containers must be stopped and removed before they can be
redeployed with the latest version. Also make sure to include in the
Docker commands any other options that you have enabled after the
original installation.
