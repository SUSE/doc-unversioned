== What is {trento}?

{trento} is the official version of the Trento community project. It is a comprehensive monitoring solution consisting of two main components: the {trserver} and the {tragent}. {trento} provides the following functionality and features:

* A user-friendly reactive Web interface for {sap} Basis administrators.
* Automated discovery of {pace} clusters using SAPHanaSR classic or angi as well as different fencing mechanisms, including diskless SBD.
* Automated discovery of SAP systems running on ABAP or JAVA stacks and HANA databases.
* Awareness of maintenance situations in a {pace} cluster at cluster, node, or resource level.
* Configuration validation for {hana} Scale-Up Performance-optimized, {hana} Scale-out and ASCS/ERS clusters deployed on Azure, AWS, GCP or on-premises bare metal platforms, including KVM and Nutanix.
* Useful information that offers insights about the execution of configuration checks.
* Delivery of configuration checks decoupled from core functionality.
* Email alerting for critical events in the monitored landscape.
* Integration of saptune into the console and specific configuration checks at host and cluster levels.
* Information about relevant patches and upgradable packages for registered hosts via integration with SUSE Multi-Linux Manager.
* Monitoring of CPU and memory usage at the host level through basic integration with {prometheus}.
* API-based architecture to facilitate integration with other monitoring tools.
* Rotating API key to protect communication from the {tragent} to the {trserver}.
* Housekeeping capabilities.

The *{trserver}* is an independent, distributed system designed to run on a {k8s} cluster or as a regular systemd stack. The {trserver} provides a Web front-end for user interaction. The {trserver} consists of the following components:

* The web component that acts as a control plane responsible for internal and external communications as well as rendering the UI.
* The checks engine named wanda that orchestrates the execution of configuration checks.
* A {postgresql} database for data persistence.
* The RabbitMQ message broker for communicating between the checks engine and the agents.
* A {prometheus} instance that retrieves the metrics collected by the {prometheus} node exporter in the registered hosts.

The *{tragent}* is a single background process (`trento-agent`) running on each monitored host of the SAP infrastructure.
