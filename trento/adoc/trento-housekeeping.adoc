== Housekeeping

When the heartbeat of an agent fails, an option to clean-up the
corresponding host is displayed in the *Hosts* overview and the
corresponding *Host details* view.

Use the *Clean up* button to remove all the components discovered by the
agent in the host (including the host itself and other components that
might depend on the ones running on the host) from the console.

For example, when cleaning up the host where the primary application
server of an {sap} System is registered, the entire {sap} System is
removed from the console.

Similarly, when a registered application or {hana} instance is no
longer discovered, an option to clean it up is displayed in the
corresponding overview and the corresponding details view.

.Clean up button in {sap} system details view

Use the *Clean up* button to remove the instance and any dependencies from
the console.

For example, cleaning up the ASCS instance of an {sap} system removes
the entire {sap} system from the console.
