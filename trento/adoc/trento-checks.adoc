== Performing configuration checks
:revdate: 2025-06-10


{trento} provides configuration checks that ensure your infrastructure
setup adheres to our or other vendor's Best Practices, and it does not
diverge with time. Configuration checks are available for HANA clusters,
ASCS/ERS clusters and hosts. The following procedure is specific to a
HANA cluster. The procedure for an ASCS/ERS cluster or a host would be
exactly the same, except it starts from the corresponding *Details* view.

[[checks-procedure, Performing configuration checks]]
. Log in to {trento}
. In the left panel, click *Cluster*.
. In the list, search for a {hana} cluster.
. Click the desired cluster name in the *Name* column. The *Details* view
opens.

. [[step-5, Step 5]]Click the *Settings* button to change the cluster settings of the
respective cluster. For checks to be executed, a checks selection must
be made. Select the checks to be executed and click *Select Checks for
Execution*.

. You can then either wait for {trento} to execute the selected checks
or trigger an execution immediately by clicking the button  in the *Checks Selection* tab.
. Investigate the result in the *Checks Results* view. Each row in the
view displays a check ID, a short description of the check and the check
execution result. Click on a row to open a section that provides
information about the execution on each node of the cluster.

The result of a check execution can be passing, warning, critical:
+
** _Passing_ means that the checked configuration meets the
recommendation.
** _Warning_ means that the recommendation is not met but the
configuration is not critical for the proper running of the cluster.
** _Critical_ means that either the execution itself failed (for
example, a timeout) or the recommendation is not met and is critical for
the well-being of the cluster.
+
Use the filter to narrow the list to specific results (for example,
critical).
. Click a check's link to open a modal box with the check description.
This displays an abstract and a possible solution to the problem. The
*References* section contains links to the documentation from the
different vendors for more context when necessary. Close the modal box
by pressing the *Esc* key or click outside of the box.
+
For each unmet expected result, there is a detailed view with
information about it: what facts were gathered, what values were
expected, and what was the result of the evaluation. This helps to
understand why a certain configuration check is failing:

When checks for a given cluster have been selected, {trento} executes
them automatically every five minutes, updating the results. A spinning
check execution result icon means that an execution is running.
