[[sec-trento-manage-tags]]
== Managing tags

Tags are used to label specific objects with location, owner, etc. The
objects can be hosts, clusters, databases or {sap} systems. Tags make
it easier to distinguish and show all these different objects, making
your lists more readable and searchable. You can use any text you like
to create your tags except blank spaces and special characters other
than + - = . , _ : and @.

The following subsection shows how you can add, remove, and filter
objects based on your tags.
