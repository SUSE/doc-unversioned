=== Getting the global health state

The dashboard allows you to determine at a glance the health status of
your {sap} environment. It is the main page of the {trweb}, and you
can always switch to it by clicking on Dashboard in the left sidebar.

The health status of a registered {sap} system is the sum of its health
status at three different layers representing the {sap} architecture:

* *Hosts* Reflects the heartbeat of the  {tragent} and the tuning status returned
by {saptune} (where applicable).
* *{pace} Clusters* The status based on the running status of the cluster and the results of
the configuration checks.
* *Database* Collects the status of the HANA instances as returned by `+sapcontrol+`.
* *Application instances* Summarizes the status of the application instances as returned by
`+sapcontrol+`.

In addition to the operating system layer, there is also information
about the health status of the HA components, where they exist:

* *Database cluster* The status based on the running status of the database cluster and the
results of the selected configuration checks.
* *Application cluster* The status based on the running status of the ASCS/ERS cluster and,
eventually, the results of the selected configuration checks.

The dashboard groups systems in three different health boxes (see link:#fig-trento-web-home[Dashboard with the global health state]):

.Dashboard with the global health state
[#fig-trento-web-home]
image::trento-web-home.png[trento-web-home,scaledwidth=80.0%]

Passing::
  Shows the number of systems with all layers with passing (green)
  status.
Warning::
  Shows the number of systems with at least one layer with warning
  (yellow) status and the rest with passing (green) status.
Critical::
  Shows the number of systems with at least one layer with critical
  (red) status.

The health boxes in the dashboard are clickable. Clicking on a box
filters the dashboard by systems with the corresponding health status.
In large {sap} environments, this feature can help the {sap}
administrator to determine which systems are in a given status.

The icons representing the health summary of a particular layer contain
links to the views in the {trento} console that can help determine the
source of the issue:

* *Hosts health icon:* Link to the Hosts overview filtered by SID equal to the SAPSID and the
DBSID of the corresponding {sap} system.
* *Database cluster health icon:* Link to the corresponding {hana} Cluster Details view.
* *Database health icon:* Link to the corresponding HANA Database Details view.
* *Application cluster health icon:* Link to the corresponding ASCS/ERS Cluster Details view.
* *Application Instances health icon:* Link to the corresponding {sap} System Details view.

Grey status is returned when either a component does not exist, or it is
stopped (as returned by `+sapcontrol+`), or its status is unknown (for
instance, if a command to determine the status fails).

Grey statuses are not yet counted in the calculation of the global
health status.

[[sec-trento-status]]
=== Viewing the status

The status allows you to see if any of the systems need to be examined
further.

The following subsection gives you an overview of specific parts of your
{sap} Landscape to show their state. Each status site shows an overview
of the health states (see details in
link:#vl-health-states[variablelist_title]).

[[sec-trento-status-hosts]]
=== Viewing the status of hosts

To display the lists of registered hosts and their details, proceed as
follows:

* Log in to the {trweb}.
* Click the Hosts entry in the left sidebar to show a summary of the
state for all hosts.
+
.Hosts entry
[#fig-trento-status-hosts]
image::trento-web-hosts-view.png[trento-web-hosts-view,scaledwidth=80.0%]
* To look into the specific host details, click the host name in the
respective column to open the corresponding Host details view. If the
list is too long, shorten it using the filters.
+
Clicking on a host name opens the corresponding Host details view the
following information:

** *Hosts Details* section shows the status of both the  {tragent} and the
Node Exporter and provides the host name, the cluster name (when
applicable), the  {tragent} version and the host IP addresses.
** *{saptune} Summary* section provides information generated by
{saptune}. {saptune} comes with {sles4sap}, and it allows {sap}
administrators to ensure that their {sap} hosts are properly configured
to run the corresponding {sap} workloads. The integration of {saptune}
in the {trento} console gives the {sap} administrator access to the
{saptune} information even when they are not working at operating
system level. The integration supports {saptune} 3.1.0 and higher, and
includes the addition of the host tuning status in the aggregated health
status of the host.
+
.saptune Summary section
[#fig-saptune-summary-section]
image::saptune-summary-section.png[saptune-summary-section,scaledwidth=80.0%]
+
If an {sap} workload is running on the host but no saptune or a version
lower than 3.1.0 is installed, a warning is added to the aggregated
health status of the host. When {saptune} version 3.1.0 or higher is
installed, a details view shows detailed information about the
{saptune} status:
+
.saptune details view
[#fig-saptune-details-view]
image::saptune-details-view.png[saptune-details-view,scaledwidth=80.0%]
** *Check Results* summary section shows a summary of the checks
execution results for the current host.
** *Available Software Updates* section shows a summary of the available
patches and upgradable packages for the current host when settings for
SUSE Multi-Linux Manager are maintained and the host is managed by the
SUSE Multi-Linux Manager instance for which connection data has been
provided. Refer to section link:#sec-integration-with-SUSE-Manager[???]
for further details.
** Monitoring dashboard shows the CPU and memory usage for the specific
hosts.
+
image::trento-web-hosts-dashboard-cpu-memory.png[trento-web-hosts-dashboard-cpu-memory,scaledwidth=80.0%]
** *Provider Details* section shows the name of the cloud provider, the
name of the virtual machine, the name of the resource group it belongs
to, the location, the size of the virtual machine, and other
information.
** *{sap} Instances* section lists the ID, SID, type, features, and
instance number of any {sap} instance running on the host ({netweaver}
or {hana}).
** *{suse} Subscription Details* section lists the different components
or modules that are part of the subscription. For each component and
module, the section shows the architecture, the version and type, the
registration and subscription status as well as the start and end dates
of the subscription.

The detail views of a HANA cluster and an ASCS/ERS cluster are
different:

** The *Settings*, *Show Results*, and *Start Execution* buttons are used to
enable or disable checks and to start them. To execute specific checks,
follow the instructions in link:#st-trento-checks-settings[???] of
link:#pro-trento-checks[???].
** Top section displays the cloud provider, the cluster type, the HANA
log replication mode, the DBSID, the cluster maintenance status, the
HANA secondary sync state, the fencing type, when the CIB was last
written, and the HANA log operation mode.
** The *Checks Results* section provides a summary of the check execution
results for the particular cluster.
** The *{pace} Site Details* section is split in three subsections: one for
each HANA site, and another one for cluster nodes without a HANA
workload. For example, in case of a majority maker in a HANA scale out
cluster, each HANA site subsection informs about the site role (Primary
or Secondary or Failed) and lists the different nodes in the site. Each
node entry displays the node status (Online or Maintenance or Other),
the roles of the nameserver and indexserver services in that node, the
local IPs and any assigned virtual IP address. To view the attributes of
that node, the resources running on it and their statuses, click the
Details button. Close the view using the key.
** The *Stopped Resources* section provides a summary of resources which have
been stopped on the cluster.
** The *SBD/Fencing* section shows the status of each SBD device when
applicable.
** A top section on the left shows the cloud provider, the cluster type,
fencing type, when the CIB was last written and the cluster maintenance
status.
** The next top-center multi-tab section shows the SAP SID, the Enqueue
Server version, whether the ASCS and ERS are running on different hosts
or not, and whether the instance filesystems are resource based or not.
When multiple systems share the same cluster, there is a tab for each
system in the cluster, and you can scroll left and right to go through
the different systems.
** The *Checks Results* section shows a summary of the results of the last
check execution, when applicable.
** The *Node Details* section shows the following for each node in the
cluster: the node status (Online or Maintenance or Other), the host
name, the role of the node in the cluster, the assigned virtual IP
address and, in case of resource managed filesystems, the full mounting
path. To view the attributes and resources associated to that particular
node, click Details. Close the view using the key.
+
This section is system-specific. It shows the information corresponding
to the system selected in the multi-tab section above.
** The *Stopped Resources* section displays a summary of resources which have
been stopped on the cluster.
** The *SBD/Fencing* section shows the status of each SBD device when
applicable.
