== Updating {trento} Checks

Configuration checks are an integral part of the checks engine, but they
are delivered separately. This allows customers to update the checks
catalog in their setup whenever updates to existing checks and new
checks are released, without waiting for a new version release cycle.

The procedure of updating the configuration checks depends on the
{trserver} deployment type: {k8s}, systemd or containerized.

In a {k8s} deployment, checks are delivered as a container image, and
you can use Helm with the following options to pull the latest image:

....
  helm ... \
 --set trento-wanda.checks.image.tag=latest \
 --set trento-wanda.checks.image.repository=registry.suse.com/trento/trento-checks  \
 --set trento-wanda.checks.image.pullPolicy=Always \
 ...
....

In a systemd deployment, checks are delivered as an RPM package, and you
can use Zypper to update your checks catalog:

....
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper update trento-checks
....

In a containerized deployment, checks are delivered as a container
image, and you can user Docker to pull the latest version into the
trento-checks volume created during the installation process:

....
docker run \
-v trento-checks:/usr/share/trento/checks \
registry.suse.com/trento/trento-checks:latest
....
