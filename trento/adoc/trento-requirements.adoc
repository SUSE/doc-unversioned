== Requirements

This section describes requirements for the {trserver} and its {tragent}s.

[[sec-trento-server-requirements]]
=== {trserver} requirements

Running all the {trserver} components requires a minimum of 4 GB of RAM, two CPU cores and 64 GB of storage. When using K3s, such storage should be provided under `/var/lib/rancher/k3s`.

{trento} is based on an event-driven technology. Registered events are stored in a {postgresql} database with a default retention period of 10 days. For each host registered with {trento}, you need to allocate at least 1.5GB of space in the {postgresql} database.

{trserver} supports different deployment scenarios: {k8s}, systemd, and containers. A {k8s}-based deployment of {trserver} is cloud-native and OS-agnostic. It can be performed on the following services:

* RKE1 ({rancher.k8s.engine} version 1)
* RKE2
* a {k8s} service in a cloud provider
* any other CNCF-certified {k8s} running on x86_64 architecture

A production-ready {k8s}-based deployment of {trserver} requires {k8s} knowledge. The Helm chart is intended to be used by customers without in-house {k8s} expertise, or as a way to try {trento} with a minimum of effort. However, Helm chart delivers a basic deployment of the {trserver} with all the components running on a single node of the cluster.

[[sec-trento-agent-requirements]]
=== {tragent} requirements

The resource footprint of the {tragent} is designed to not impact the performance of the host it runs on.

The {tragent} component needs to interact with several low-level system components that are part of the {sles4sap} distribution.

The hosts must have unique machine identifiers (ids) in order to be registered in Trento. This means that if a host in your environment is built as a clone of another one, make sure to change the machine's identifier as part of the cloning process before starting the {tragent} on it.

Similarly, the clusters must have unique authkeys on the clusters in order to be registered in {trento}.

[[sec-trento-network-requirements]]
=== Network requirements

* The Web component of the {trserver} must be reachable from any {tragent} host via HTTP (port TCP/80) or via HTTPS (port TCP/443) if SSL is enabled.
* The checks engine component of the {trserver} must be reachable from any {tragent} host via Advanced Message Queuing Protocol or AMQP (port TCP/5672).
* The Prometheus component of the {trserver} must be able to reach the Node Exporter in the {tragent} hosts (port TCP/9100).
* The {sap} Basis administrator must access to the Web component of the {trserver} via HTTP (port TCP/80) or via HTTPS (port TCP/443) if SSL is enabled.

[[sec-trento-installation-prerequisites]]
=== Installation prerequisites

*  *{trserver}* For a {k8s}-based deployment, you must have access to {suse} public registry for the deployment of {trserver} containers. For a systemd deployment, you must have a registered {sles4sap} 15 (SP3 or higher) distribution. The same applies to a containerized deployment.
* *{tragent}s* A registered {sles4sap} 15 (SP3 or higher) distribution.
