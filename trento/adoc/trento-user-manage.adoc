== User management

{trento} provides a local permission-based user management feature with
optional multi-factor authentication. This feature enables segregation
of duties in the {trento} interface and ensures that only authorized
users with the right permissions can access it.

User management actions are performed in the Users view in the left-hand
side panel of the {trweb}.

By default, a newly created user is granted display access rights except
for the Users view. Where available, a user with default access can
configure filters and pagination settings matching their preferences.

To perform protected actions, the user must have additional permissions
added to their user profile. Below is the list of currently available
permissions:

* `+all:users+`: grants full access to user management actions under the
Users view
* `+all:checks_selection+`: grants check selection capabilities for any
target in the registered environment for which checks are available
* `+all:checks_execution+`: grants check execution capabilities for any
target in the registered environment for which checks are available and
have been previously selected
* `+all:tags+`: allows creation and deletion of the available tags
* `+cleanup:all+`: allows triggering housekeeping actions on hosts where
agents heartbeat is lost and SAP or HANA instances that are no longer
found
* `+all:settings+`: grants changing capabilities on any system settings
under the Settings view
* `+all:all+`: grants all the permissions above

Using the described permissions, it is possible to create the following
types of users:

* *User managers:* users with `+all:users+` permissions
*  *SAP Basis administrator with {trento} display-only access:* users with default permissions
*  *SAP Basis administrator with {trento} configuration access*: users with `+all:checks_selection+`, `+all:tags+` and `+all:settings+`
permissions
* *SAP Basis administrator with {trento} operation access:* users with `+all:check_execution+` and `+cleanup:all+` permissions.

The default admin user created during the installation process is
granted `+all:all+` permissions and cannot be modified or deleted. Use
it only to create the first user manager (a user with `+all:users+`
permissions who creates all the other required users). Once a user with
`+all:users+` permissions is created, the default admin user must be
treated as a fallback user in case all other access to the console is
lost. If the password of the default admin user is lost, it can be reset
by updating the Helm chart or the web component configuration, depending
on which deployment method was used to install \{t.server}.

User passwords, including the default admin user password, must follow
the rules below:

* Password must contain at least 8 characters
* The same number or letter must not be repeated three or more times in
a row (for example: 111 or aaa)
* Password must not contain four consecutive numbers or letters (for
example: 1234, abcd or ABCD)

The Create User and Edit User views provide a built-in password
generation button that allows user managers to easily generate secure
and compliant passwords. The user manager must provide the user with
their password through an authorized secure channel.

A user can reset their password in the Profile view. In this view, they
can also update their name and email address as well as activate
multi-factor authentication using an authenticator app. Multi-factor
authentication increases the security of a user account by requesting a
temporary second password or code when logging in the console. User
managers can disable multi-factor authentication for any given user that
has it enabled. However, user managers cannot enable multi-factor
authentication on their behalf. The default admin user cannot enable its
own multi-factor authentication.

[NOTE]
.Security Tip for Multi-Factor Authentication
====
Since multi-factor authentication cannot be enabled for the default
admin user, keeping its password safe is imperative. If the default
admin user's password is compromised, reset it immediately by updating
the Helm chart or the web component configuration, depending on which
deployment method was used to install \{t.server}.
====

User managers can enable and disable users. When a user logged in the
console is disabled by a user admin, their session is terminated
immediately.
