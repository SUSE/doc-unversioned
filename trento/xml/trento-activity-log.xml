    commonly refered to as resource type, and by the user that triggered the
    event or performed the action. Only active users are available for

    and/or older than an specific date and time (server time).

    Once a filter has been set, the user must click Apply to filter out the
    undesired entries and Reset to remove all the filters.

    The pagination features at the bottom of the Activity Log allow the user to

    and back to first one.

    time).
