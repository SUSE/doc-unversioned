  <title>User management</title>
  <para>
    {trento} provides a local permission-based user management feature with
    optional multi-factor authentication. This feature enables segregation of
    duties in the {trento} interface and ensures that only authorized users with
    the right permissions can access it.
  </para>
  <para>
    User management actions are performed in the <guimenu>Users</guimenu> view
    in the left-hand side panel of the {t.web}.
  </para>
  <para>
    By default, a newly created user is granted display access rights except for
    the <guimenu>Users</guimenu> view. Where available, a user with default
    access can configure filters and pagination settings matching their
    preferences.
  </para>
  <para>
  To perform protected actions, the user must have additional permissions added
  to their user profile. Below is the list of currently available permissions:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>

    Using the described permissions, it is possible to create the following types of users:

  <para>
    The default admin user created during the installation process is granted
    <constant>all:all</constant> permissions and cannot be modified or deleted.
    Use it only to create the first user manager (a user with
    <constant>all:users</constant> permissions who creates all the other
    required users). Once a user with <constant>all:users</constant> permissions
    is created, the default admin user must be treated as a fallback user in
    case all other access to the console is lost. If the password of the default
    admin user is lost, it can be reset by updating the Helm chart or the web
    component configuration, depending on which deployment method was used to
    install {t.server}.
  </para>
  <para>
    User passwords, including the default admin user password, must follow the rules below:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Password must contain at least 8 characters
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The same number or letter must not be repeated three or more times in a
        row (for example: 111 or aaa)
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Password must not contain four consecutive numbers or letters (for
        example: 1234, abcd or ABCD)
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    The <guimenu>Create User</guimenu> and <guimenu>Edit User</guimenu> views
    provide a built-in password generation button that allows user
    managers to easily generate secure and compliant passwords. The user manager
    must provide the user with their password through an authorized secure
    channel.
  </para>
  <para>
    A user can reset their password in the <guimenu>Profile</guimenu> view. In
    this view, they can also update their name and email address as well as
    activate multi-factor authentication using an authenticator app.
    Multi-factor authentication increases the security of a user account by
    requesting a temporary second password or code when logging in the console.
    User managers can disable multi-factor authentication for any given user
    that has it enabled. However, user managers cannot enable multi-factor
    authentication on their behalf. The default admin user cannot enable its own
    multi-factor authentication.
  </para>
  <note>
    <title>Security Tip for Multi-Factor Authentication</title>
    <para>
      Since multi-factor authentication cannot be enabled for the default admin
      user, keeping its password safe is imperative. If the default admin user's
      password is compromised, reset it immediately by updating the Helm chart
      or the web component configuration, depending on which deployment method
      was used to install {t.server}.
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    User managers can enable and disable users. When a user logged in the
    console is disabled by a user admin, their session is terminated
    immediately.
