  <title>Updating Trento Checks</title>
  <para>Configuration checks are an integral part of the checks engine, but they are delivered separately from it. This allows customers
  to update the checks catalog in their setup whenever updates to existing checks and new checks are released, without
  waiting for a new version release cycle.</para>
       <para> The procedure of updating the configuration checks depends on the &t.server; deployment type: &k8s;, systemd or containerized.</para>
   <para>In a k8s; deployment, checks are delivered as a container image and you can
    use Helm with the following options to pull the latest one available into your setup:</para>
<programlisting>
  helm ... \
 --set trento-wanda.checks.image.tag=latest \
 --set trento-wanda.checks.image.repository=registry.suse.com/trento/trento-checks  \
 --set trento-wanda.checks.image.pullPolicy=Always \
 ...
</programlisting>
   <para>In a systemd deployment, checks are delivered as an RPM package, and you can 
    use zypper to update your checks catalog to the latest version:</para>
      <screen>&prompt.user;sudo zypper ref
&prompt.user;sudo zypper update trento-checks</screen>
  <para>In a containerized deployment, checks are delivered as a container image, and
   you can user Docker to pull the latest version into the trento-checks volume that was
   created during the installation process:</para>
<screen>&prompt.user;docker run \
-v trento-checks:/usr/share/trento/checks \
registry.suse.com/trento/trento-checks:latest
</screen>
