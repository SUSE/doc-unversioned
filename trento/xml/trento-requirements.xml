    <para> This section describes requirements for the &t.server; and its
      &t.agent;s. </para>

      <title>&t.server; requirements</title>
      <para> Running all the &t.server; components requires a minimum of
      4&nbsp;GB of RAM, two CPU cores and 64&nbsp;GB of storage. When using K3s,
      such storage should be provided under
      <filename>/var/lib/rancher/k3s</filename>.
      </para>
     <para>
      &trento; is based on an event-driven technology. Registered events are stored in a  &postgresql; database with a default retention
      period of 10 days. For each host registered with &trento;, you need to allocate at least 1.5GB of space in the &postgresql; database.
     </para>
      <para> &t.server; supports different deployment scenarios: &k8s;, systemd, and containers. A &k8s;-based deployment of &t.server; is cloud-native and OS-agnostic. It can be performed on the following services: </para>

     <para> A production-ready &k8s;-based deployment of &t.server; requires
     &k8s; knowledge. The Helm chart is intended to be used by customers without
     in-house &k8s; expertise, or as a way to try &trento; with a minimum of
     effort. However, Helm chart delivers a basic deployment of the &t.server;
     with all the components running on a single node of the cluster.</para>

    <section xml:id="sec-trento-agent-requirements">
      <title>&t.agent; requirements</title>
      <para> The resource footprint of the &t.agent; is designed to not
        impact the performance of the host it runs on. </para>
      <para> The &t.agent; component needs to interact with several
        low-level system components that are part of the &sles4sap; distribution. </para>
           <para>The hosts must have unique machine identifiers (ids) in order to be registered in Trento. This means that if a host in your environment is built as a clone of another one,
           make sure to change the machine's identifier as part of the cloning process before starting the &t.agent; on it. </para>
                <para> Similarly, the clusters must have unique authkeys on the clusters in order to be registered in &trento;.</para>
